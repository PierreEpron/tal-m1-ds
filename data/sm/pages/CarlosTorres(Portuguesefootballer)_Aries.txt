In 1933, he moved to Benfica, making his debut on 25 February 1934, against Belenenses. He competed with Rogério and Vítor Silva, but was still the team top scorer, bagging seven goals in seven appearances. The following season, Benfica signed Valadas, which brought more competition to him. Nonetheless, he scored 16 and helped the club win the Campeonato de Portugal on 30 June 1935, against Sporting.In 1935–36, Torres scored 9 in the Primeira Liga and helped Benfica win their first league title. With the breakthrough of Espírito Santos in 1936–37, his influence was significantly reduced and he did not play in the league, thus not winning his second league title.
