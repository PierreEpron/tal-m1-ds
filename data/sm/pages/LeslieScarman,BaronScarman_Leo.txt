He was called to the bar at the Middle Temple in 1936. He remained briefless until World War II, which he spent in the Royal Air Force as a staff officer in England, North Africa, and then continental Europe. He was present with Arthur Tedder when Alfred Jodl surrendered at Reims. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1944. He returned to law in 1945, practising from chambers at 2, Crown Office Row, known since the 1970s as Fountain Court Chambers, and in the late 1940s and early 1950s he started to build the chambers' reputation for commercial litigation, together with Alan Orr and Melford Stevenson, supported by a notable clerk, Cyril Batchelor. He became a Queen's Counsel in 1957.
Scarman was appointed a High Court judge in 1961, assigned to the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division, transferring to the Family Division when the latter was created in 1971.
