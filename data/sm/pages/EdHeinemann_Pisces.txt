Edward Henry Heinemann (March 14, 1908 – November 26, 1991) was a military aircraft designer for the Douglas Aircraft Company.


== Biography ==
Heinemann was born in Saginaw, Michigan. He moved to California as a boy and was raised in Los Angeles. A self-taught engineer, he joined Douglas Aircraft as a draftsman in 1926, but was laid off within a year.  After stints at International Aircraft, Moreland Aircraft, and the first Northrop Corporation, Heinemann rejoined Douglas after it acquired Northrop. Heinemann became Douglas's Chief Engineer in 1936. He remained with the company through 1960, when he left to join Guidance Technology. In 1962 he joined General Dynamics as Corporate Vice President of Engineering.  In this position he oversaw the development of the F-16.  He retired in 1973.
The famed airplane designer Burt Rutan would list Heinemann as among the leading pioneers in aviation who had inspired him to become an aerospace engineer.His approach to aircraft design was uncomplicated, once saying that he simply took the most powerful engine available and designed the aircraft around it.


== Designs ==
During his long career at Douglas, Heinemann designed more than 20 combat aircraft, primarily for the U.S. Navy, including many that became legends in aviation history. His designs included the following aircraft:

SBD Dauntless dive bomber
