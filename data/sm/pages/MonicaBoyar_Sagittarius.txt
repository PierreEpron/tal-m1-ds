Boyar became a United States citizen after residing in the country from the age of eight. She was a dedicated student of the folk music of all countries.
She was called the satin Latin song stylist. and sometimes the Ruban Blue-Bird. Walter Winchell said that she was the finest Latin talent in the entertainment field in 1960.
During the 1939 New York World's Fair she made a concerted effort to persuade Americans to adopt the Dominican Republic's native dance, the merengue. An initial reluctance eventually subsided, and by 1955 it was the fastest growing dance in the U.S. When Boyar introduced calypso songs to America, many felt the music was not commercial. By 1954 calypso songs were among the bestsellers.
She introduced a new song, That's Why A Woman Loves A Heel, in October 1945. By 1948 Boyar had appeared on every overseas radio network. Boyar entertained at Ciro's in Mexico City and the Hotel Nacional in Havana. Among her numerous nightclub engagements was a December 1955 performance at the Viennese Lantern, at 242 East 79th Street in Yorkville, Manhattan. A lawsuit was taken out by an angry tenant who resided above the club. He contended that Boyar's bongo drummer kept him awake.

Her second husband was actor Leslie Nielsen, from 1950 to 1956. They separated in August 1955, with Nielsen obtaining a default divorce in June 1956. He agreed to pay $19,000 ($148,100 today) in lieu of alimony, by monthly installments of $500.
