== Testimonies ==
The architect and scholar of Paraguayan history Jorge Rubbiani stated: "Alfredo offered all Paraguayans a mirror that since we returned, with disturbing fidelity, the Paraguayan reality of this, and also made it possible to know the facts in their true dimension, demystify, argue about any conflicts that acquired notoriety simply because they never knew the extent of their insignificance. The reports, studies and analyses made by Alfredo extinguish many "official versions" enshrined by interests that had nothing to do with the history and let us return the voice of "silenced" by those excluded from key players in camouflaged anonymity imposed by bureaucratic controls.
Maestro Paraguayan Luis Szarán stated: "Alfredo taught us by example to understand irony and the deepest questions of life., in a practical way and rationals"
