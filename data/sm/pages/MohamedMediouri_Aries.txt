== Early life ==
Mohammed Mediouri started his career as policeman in the CMI (compagnie marocaine d'intervention), the riot control division of the Moroccan police. After the coups attempts of the early 1970s Hassan II realised that his security was insufficient and tasked Raymond Sassia (former bodyguard of Charles de Gaulle) with the formation of a new security for the monarch. Sassia recruited and trained, with the assistance of Hadj Ahmed El Faqir, Mediouri among others, but he became close to the king and he eventually replaced Sassia in the late 1970s as chief of security in the royal palace. In 1999, he married the widow of King Hassan II.
