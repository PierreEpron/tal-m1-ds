== Early life ==

== Career ==
Reid got her start at age sixteen in 1980 as a backing vocalist for the percussionist/band leader Bill Summers and the funk band Con Funk Shun. Reid co-wrote one of Con Funk Shun's singles, "Body Lovers". A local musician gave Reid a production deal which fell through several months later when she became pregnant with her daughter. While working at an Oakland, California, real estate office she met contractor George L. Smith, who she later married. Smith bankrolled Pebbles with $80,000 for a demo tape and video for "Mercedes Boy". The demo and video led to a contract with MCA. She recorded several hit singles on her own during the late 1980s and early 1990s, including "Girlfriend", "Mercedes Boy", "Giving You the Benefit", "Love Makes Things Happen", and "Backyard". Reid's cousin is R&B singer Cherrelle who was featured, along with Johnny Gill, on her 1991 hit song, "Always". 
Meanwhile, by the time she began scoring her first solo successes, she and Smith had split.  
In July 1989, Pebbles formed the Atlanta-based production company Pebbitone and founded her own record label, Savvy Records. Pebbitone managed TLC, which was signed with her then husband L.A. Reid's record label LaFace Records. When TLC filed for bankruptcy in 1995, due to Pebbles' alleged mismanagement regarding their funds, the ensuing conflict damaged Pebbles' marriage. She divorced Reid, and Pebbitone sued LaFace for $10 million.In 1997, Pebbles underwent a religious conversion. Under her new stage name "Sister Perri", she founded Women of God Changing Lives (WOGCL) Ministries. As an ordained minister, she now preaches and ministers through song. In 2008, after a thirteen-year music hiatus, Reid released her fourth album and debut gospel album, Prophetic Flows Vol I & II, which peaked at #12 on the Billboard Gospel Album Chart. In February 2011, she was named the executive producer/host of Essence's national R&B search.
