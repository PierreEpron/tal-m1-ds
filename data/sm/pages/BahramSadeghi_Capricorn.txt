Bahram Sadeghi (Persian: بهرام صادقی, romanized: Bahrām Sadeqī; 8 January 1937, in Najaf-Ābād, Isfahan  – 3 January 1985, in Tehran) was an Iranian poet and modernist fiction writer.
Sadeghi's characters, many of them failed government employees and frustrated intellectuals, are consumed by anxiety and terror, and at times even undergo Kafkaesque transmutations and mutilations.
