== Early life ==
Matthew David Benson was born in Oak Park, Illinois and is one of seven siblings.  He began singing in the church choir and church events when he was a young child. Benson was inspired to become a singer by his grandmother.  In 2005, Benson and his brothers formed a singing trio, TriEnd (pronounced trend). TriEnd dissolved in 2008 and Matt B began his solo career in 2009."My family had been singing for a very long time, as long as I can remember, said Benson. My grandmother was born in 1919 so she was born in an era where it wasnâ€™t safe for black people to travel nationally or even internationally and they had to watch where they went. The fact that my grandmother was able to be a part of something like that back in the 1940s and travel all across the United States singing was inspirational to me and just amazing.
