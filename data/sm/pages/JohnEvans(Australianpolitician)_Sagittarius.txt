Sir John William Evans, CMG (1 December 1855 â€“ 2 October 1943) was an Australian politician, a member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly and Premier of Tasmania from 11 July 1904 to 19 June 1909.


== Early life and nautical career ==
Evans was born in 1855 in Liverpool, England, but migrated with his family to Battery Point, Tasmania when he was four years old. After education in Hobart, Evans embarked on a year-long voyage through Asian ports with his parents. His father, a merchant seaman, arranged an apprenticeship for him on his part-owned barque, Helen, trading to China and Japan.


== Political career ==
John Evans was first elected to the Tasmanian House of Assembly in the electorate of Kingborough on 20 January 1897. He did not have a political party, at this time, but is described as Anti-Socialist. Evans became Premier on 12 July 1904, holding office until 19 June 1909. In 1909 his seat of Kingborough was abolished and replaced with the Division of Franklin. He won the seat back in 1909 and continued to serve in parliament until 1937 as Commonwealth Liberal and Nationalist. His time in parliament, forty years from 1897 to 1937, makes him the longest-serving member in Tasmania.
