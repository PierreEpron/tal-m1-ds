After relocating temporarily to London in 1888, the family migrated to Australia in January 1891. In 1892 his father was accidentally shot, causing lasting health problems for Rev. Laseron who resigned his post in Sydney three years later and then moved his family to Lithgow, New South Wales where he was given charge of the parish.Charles attended St Andrew's Cathedral School as scholar and chorister and later studied at Sydney Technical College where he was awarded the diploma in geology. He was employed by the Technological Museum in July 1906 and published a series of papers.
