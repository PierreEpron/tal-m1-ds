== Club career ==


=== Spartak ===
Grigoryev made his debut in the Russian Premier League on 21 March 2009 in a game against FC Kuban Krasnodar. He played two games in the 2008–09 UEFA Cup for FC Spartak Moscow against NK Dinamo Zagreb and Tottenham Hotspur F.C.


=== Rostov ===
In early 2011, his contract with FC Spartak Moscow expired, and he decided to switch to FC Rostov. According to Russian football regulations, when a player under 23 years of age who was raised in the club system transfers to a different club after his contract expires, his old club is due compensation from his new club. If the new club plays on the third level (Russian Second Division), the compensation is the player's previous 5 years' salary multiplied by 1, if his new club is in the Russian First Division, it's multiplied by 2 and if it's a Russian Premier League club, it's multiplied by 3. Grigoryev and two other Spartak alumni, Dmitri Malyaka and Yevgeni Filippov, signed with a Russian Second Division team FC MITOS Novocherkassk who immediately loaned them to the Russian Premier League team FC Rostov. Spartak lodged a complaint with the Russian Football Union, claiming this was not a fair transfer as the only reason for it was to lower the compensation that FC Rostov was due to pay Spartak. After the protest was declined on 29 March 2011, Grigoryev was registered for FC Rostov and scored a goal on his debut against FC Lokomotiv Moscow on 2 April 2011. FC Lokomotiv's president, Olga Smorodskaya, filed a complaint with the Russian Football Union and Premier League, claiming Grigoryev was not eligible to be registered and play for FC Rostov. Lokomotiv's protest was eventually denied.
