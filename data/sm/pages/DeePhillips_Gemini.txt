However, he was declared a free agent by Commissioner of Baseball Kenesaw Mountain Landis after the 1939 season and was barred from re-signing with Detroit. He eventually joined the Reds' organization and was called to the majors in the middle of the 1942 season. He appeared in 28 games for Cincinnati and batted .202 in 84 at-bats.

He then served in the United States Army and lost the 1945 season, and most of 1946, to military service.
