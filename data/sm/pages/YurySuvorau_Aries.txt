Yury Yurievich Suvorau (Belarusian: Юрый Юр'евіч Сувораў; born March 29, 1991, in Vitebsk) is a Belarusian swimmer, who specialized in individual medley events. Suvorau qualified for the men's 400 m individual medley, as a member of the Belarusian swimming team, at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, by attaining a B-standard entry time of 4:23.35. Suvorau challenged seven other swimmers in the second heat, including two-time Olympian Raphaël Stacchiotti of Luxembourg. He finished the race in a third-place tie with Portugal's Diogo Carvalho, in a new Belarusian record time of 4:23.06. Suvorau, however, failed to advance into the final, as he placed twenty-sixth out of 37 swimmers in the preliminary heats.
