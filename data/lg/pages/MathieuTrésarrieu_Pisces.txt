== Biography ==
Trésarrieu was born in Bordeaux in 1986, and took up speedway at the age of twelve. His two older brothers Stéphane and Sebastien are also speedway riders. He won the French national championship for the first time in 2002. Between 2002 and 2003 he rode for the Isle of Wight Islanders in seven matches, but only got a regular league place in 2005 when he rode in forty matches for Reading Racers at an average score of 5.6.In 2006 he moved on to Redcar Bears, where he stayed for two seasons, averaging over seven in each. He won the French title for a second time in 2007, and (after missing the 2008 season through injury) for a third time in 2009. He also finished third in the Individual Speedway Long Track World Championship in 2007. He returned to British speedway in 2010 in the Elite League with Peterborough Panthers, but failed to get a starting place at the start of the 2011 season. An injury to Ilya Bondarenko gave him an opportunity with Leicester Lions, and later in 2011 he signed for Ipswich Witches to replace the injured Chris Schramm, riding as part of the team that won the Premier League Four-Team Championship at Leicester.Mat re-joined Ipswich in 2012, electing to focus on speedway, rather than grass and long track racing.
In 2022, he won his second World Longtrack title, finishing 28 points clear of Zach Wajtknecht in the 2022 Individual Long Track World Championship.
