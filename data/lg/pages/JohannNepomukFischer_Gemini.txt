Johann Nepomuk Fischer (29 May 1777, Rumburk – 17 October 1847, Prague) was an Austrian ophthalmologist. He is considered to be the founder of modern ophthalmology in Bohemia.
He studied medicine at the University of Vienna as a student of Georg Joseph Beer. In 1806 he received his doctorate in medicine, and several years later, was named head of the newly founded eye clinic in Prague (1814). In 1830 he attained the chair of ophthalmology at the University of Prague. Among his better-known students was Carl Ferdinand von Arlt.
