The native of Freetown, Sierra Leone, spent his youth football playing in the Craig Bellamy Academy before obtaining a student visa to study at Hartpury College to further pursue his football career.He graduated from Hartpury College in 2016, scoring 18 goals in six outings in the English Schools' FA Cup.

Whilst visiting a friend, he featured for Newquay once on 23 August 2015 in a 2–2 South West Peninsula League draw against Ivybridge Town, netting two goals in less than thirty minutes as a substitute. Newquay manager Sash Wheatman acclaimed him as "the best player he's had the privilege of watching at this level of football", adding "it was like bringing on Ronaldo on or Gareth Bale – he was streets ahead".Bundu spent a season at Hereford, winning three trophies and reaching the FA Vase final in 2016. Work authorisation restrictions only allowed him to play his trade in a club no higher than step five of the English non-league pyramid, the ninth tier overall in the English football league system, which forced him to leave Hereford as they had been promoted to step four (tier eight). The goalscorer returned briefly to spectate one of their games, a 6–0 defeat of Bridgwater Town in the Southern Football League.
