He started writing the column in Malayalanadu weekly in 1969 and it ran for a number of years before moving to Kalakaumudi weekly when Malayalanadu closed down and finally to Samakalika Malayalam Vaarika where it stayed until his death in 2006. Though his column was criticised for its alleged superficiality, the column helped a very large section of readers of Kerala to the world of literature from the Latin America, Europe, Africa and Asia. His critique of works by Malayalam authors were said to be impartial irrespective of whether the writer was a novice or an established one; he also used the column to comment upon the society. Nair, himself, did not consider the column as literary criticism, but preferred to call it literary journalism. Sahithya Vaaraphalam has since been compiled as a book and is also available online.
