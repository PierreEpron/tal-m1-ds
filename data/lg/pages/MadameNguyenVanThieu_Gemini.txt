As her family were wealthy herbal medicine practitioners, she was greatly influenced by the feudal order and family especially in the way she treated people.In her youth, she and her sister, Tám Hảo, often went to Saigon to study and visit relatives. Due to the family's acquaintance with pharmacist Huynh Van Xuan, who worked at the Trang Hai Apothecary Institute, the two sisters worked as pharmacists at the Roussell Apothecary Institute. Huynh Van Xuan worked as a matchmaker for Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. Mai Anh's uncle, Đặng Văn Quang, was in Da Lat with Thieu, so the relationship was quickly promoted. There were some obstacles because Mai Anh was a Catholic, while Thiệu was Buddhist. They officially wed in 1951. In 1958, Thiệu was baptized as a Catholic.

=== First Lady of South Vietnam ===
From 1967 to 1975, her husband reached the peak of power. Unlike First Lady Trần Lệ Xuân, she did not participate in politics at all, but rather engaged in social activities.

She always kept the simple lifestyle of a kind and tolerant woman of the Mekong Delta. To me, Mrs. Thiệu is more of a mother and a brave wife than a First Lady living in the pinnacle of power and luxury. She is typical of the type of woman who grew up in a family fully absorbed a Confucian education (although she is a Catholic) that we often see in Southern society in the 40s. Ms. Thiệu always radiate clarity and joy. She never questioned the behavior of subordinates. Every time we met, she always asked us about our health first, not having time for us to greet her. The special thing is that she never mentioned anything related to Mr. Thiệu's work with us. During my time working here, only once did I hear her complain to Mr. Thiệu in very mild words about a powerful figure at the Presidential Palace while I was standing beside him.

Prior to the Fall of Saigon, President Thiệu announced his resignation on television. The family left South Vietnam on 21 April 1975 to Taiwan.
