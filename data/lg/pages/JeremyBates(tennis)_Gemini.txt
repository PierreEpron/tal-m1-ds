== Career ==
Bates turned professional in 1982. Partnering his fellow British player Jo Durie, he won the mixed doubles titles at Wimbledon in 1987, the first British doubles team to win the title for 51 years and the Australian Open in 1991, the first time a British doubles team has ever won the title. He was also a Men's Doubles runner-up at the Australian Open in 1988 (partnering Sweden's Peter Lundgren).
As a singles player, Bates reached the fourth round at Wimbledon twice – in 1992 and 1994 – losing on both occasions to France's Guy Forget. In the 1992 encounter, Bates held a match point against Forget in the fourth set, but failed to convert it and ended up losing in five sets 7–6, 4–6, 6–3, 6–7, 3–6, narrowly missing out on a place in the quarter-finals against John McEnroe. Bates was also the first ever opponent of Andre Agassi in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament, in the first round of the 1986 US Open, with Bates winning in four sets against the 16-year-old wildcard Agassi.
Bates won one top-level singles title during his career – at Seoul in 1994 when he was aged 31, becoming the first British male to win an ATP tour title since 1977 (he was the oldest champion on the tour that season). He also won three men's doubles titles at Tel Aviv (1989), Queen's Club (1990), and Rotterdam (1994). He was the British national champion six times, and played in 20 Davis Cup ties for Britain, scoring 27 wins and 24 losses. His career-high rankings were World No. 54 in singles (in 1995) and World No. 25 in doubles (in 1991).
