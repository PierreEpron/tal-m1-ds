What started as a handful of voices soon became the Act for Change project. The organisations first public event was a sold out debate chaired by Baroness Shami Chakrabarti, then of the human rights group, Liberty. Held at London's Young Vic Theatre, the pilot debate was attended by various leading industry figures, including the Head of ITV Drama. Unprecedented public support followed and Act For Change was formed as a way of "drawing attention to the lack of equality that exists within the UK live and recorded arts." In 2015 The Act For Change Project became a registered charity.
