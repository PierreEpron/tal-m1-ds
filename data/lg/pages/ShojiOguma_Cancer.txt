Oguma turned pro in 1970 and in 1974 won the WBC Flyweight Title by winning a split decision over Betulio González. He lost the title three months later in his first defense against Miguel Canto. In 1976, Oguma challenged WBA Flyweight champion Alfonso Lopez but lost a majority decision. In 1978 he landed a rematch with WBC Flyweight champion Canto but came up short with a split decision loss. Later that year he fought his third bout with Canto, and this time lost a more clear unanimous decision to complete their trilogy.
In 1979 he rematched WBA Flyweight champion Gonzalez and the result was a draw. Later that year they fought a rematch and Gonzalez came up with the victory via a 12th-round KO in their third match.


== Winning the lineal championship ==
In 1980 Oguma landed a shot at WBC and Lineal Flyweight Champion Chan-Hee Park and KO'd Park in the 9th round to capture the titles. He defended the titles twice the same year, including a split decision over Park, and his annual performance was named Ring magazine Comeback of the Year for 1980. 
In 1981 Oguma defended the titles successfully again against Park, but lost the belts in his following bout by KO to Antonio Avelar. He then moved up in weight and in 1982 took on WBA Super Flyweight Title holder Jiro Watanabe, but was TKO'd in the 12th. Oguma retired after the bout.
