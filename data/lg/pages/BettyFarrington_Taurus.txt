== Same-named actress from an earlier generation ==
A stage actress named Betty Farrington was active during the late 19th and early 20th century and is described in a September 1914 Reading Eagle article as having "planned to retire this winter and spend the season at her home in Washington", but will instead appear "at the Grand Theatre [in Reading] on Monday evening, Sept. 14, in the leading role of the great American comedy drama, 'The Girl from Out Yonder'". The article subsequently states that, "she was the leading woman for the Orpheum Players during the latter part of the season of 1913–1914. Born in Middletown, Miss Farrington is distinctly a Pennsylvania girl". A later paragraph begins with the words, "[H]er relatives and friends in Reading have always followed her work closely…"There is no indication that the two Betty Farringtons were related, although the write-up in the IMDb for the film actress, a native of Kansas City, Missouri, who was 16 years old in 1914, states that "[S]he had formerly been with various stock companies and was a leading performer on the Orpheum vaudeville circuit in the 1910s".
