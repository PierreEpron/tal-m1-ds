Esmond Burman Lewis (5 January 1918 â€“ 19 October 1983) was an English wicket-keeper who played first-class cricket for Warwickshire from 1949 to 1958.
He began playing for the Warwickshire Second XI in 1936 but had to wait 13 years for his first-class debut. When he finally played, against Oxford University in 1949, he took eight catches and a stumping, setting a Warwickshire record. However, he had to remain the county's reserve wicket-keeper, because the regular wicket-keeper, Dick Spooner, was a better batsman.
Lewis played as an amateur, and was selected three times to keep wicket for the Gentlemen against the Players.
