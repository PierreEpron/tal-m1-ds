== Amateur career ==
As a child, Chad owned a horse named Fern. After his cousin Craig Anderson started riding a bike, Chad discovered his interest in motorcycles and decided to trade in his horse in place for his first bike - a Yamaha PW50. The family soon purchased a small property located just outside of Kurri Kurri. The 25-acre property was overgrown with thick bushland and was yet to even have a house or electricity on the land. The family went to the property to clear the tea tree shrubs by hand at any spare chance they could find, which resulted in the family home being built along with several tracks for Chad to practice on.
Chad's family supported him along the way in his early years of competition. Without fail, weekend after weekend, his Dad Mark, his Mom Robyn, and his younger brother Troy, spent the majority of their time traveling around Australia so that Chad could compete against the rest of the country. Chad was often dubbed the 'underdog', but that was certainly something that would change in the future. Honing in on his skills on 80cc bikes, Chad's amateur career started to take off in 1997 when he took the top spot at the Australian Junior Championship.
