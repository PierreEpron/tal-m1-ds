After the PML-N had won a clear majority in the National Assembly for the second time, Ishaq Dar was inducted into the cabinet of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif as a federal minister; and, was appointed the Federal Minister for Industries and Investment in February 1997 - where he served until July 1997.In December 1997, he was made the Federal Minister for Commerce. During that time, in response to India's provocative & threatening 5 consecutive nuclear bomb tests on May 11, 1998, in a much-hyped development globally, Pakistan tested its nuclear weapons in May 1998. Major economic powers at that time, responded with harsh and heavy economic sanctions against Pakistan.As the result of economic sanctions having a multitude of global geostrategic, military, trade, investment, industrial collaboration, financial and IFIs lending repercussions, Pakistan's economy plummeted. At that juncture, Ishaq Dar was given the additional federal cabinet portfolio of Minister for Finance; with the additional charge of Revenue, Economic Affairs & Statistics.Ishaq Dar attracted limelight, scrutiny and criticism in the aftermath of Nuclear-related sanctions; but, somehow, he was able to conclude negotiations for an International Monetary Fund (IMF) bailout package to deal with an economic crisis. Ishaq Dar continued to serve in both cabinet positions until the 1999 Pakistani coup d'état; during which the then-Chief of Army Staff, General Pervez Musharraf, overthrew Nawaz Sharif and his existing elected government. Dar spent nearly two years in jail under Musharraf over corruption charges that never went to trial. His tenure as Member of the National Assembly was also terminated after the assembly's dissolution in 1999 as a result of the coup. Dar remained loyal to the PML-N during Musharraf's rule despite pressure by the Pakistan Army to switch allegiance from Nawaz Sharif. However, during his detention in 2000, Dar accused Nawaz Sharif of having engaged in money laundering in the late 1990s and, in connection with the infamous Hudabya Papers Mills case, Dar confessed to laundering US$14.86 million on behalf of the Nawaz Sharif. Later, he retreated from his statement, saying it had been extracted under duress. After having been released from jail during the Pervez Musharraf rule in Pakistan, Dar moved to the United Arab Emirates, where he worked as a financial adviser to a member of the ruling family, a position he held until 2008.

He was for the third time made the Federal Minister for Finance and was given the additional cabinet portfolios of Revenue, Economic Affairs, Statistics and Privatisation. In 2014 Dar was given the chairmanship of the Special Parliamentary Committee on Election Reforms and of Economic Coordination Committee by Nawaz Sharif. During the third premiership of Nawaz Sharif, Dar was considered so powerful that he was dubbed the de facto Deputy Prime Minister of Pakistan, mainly because of his family relationship with Nawaz Sharif. At one point he was serving as the chairman of over 45 committees. Dar was considered the most powerful member of Nawaz Sharif cabinet who in 2016, looked after important government matters when Nawaz Sharif underwent heart surgery in the United Kingdom.In July 2016 the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) cleared Dar in an over Rs 130 billion corruption case. Dar had previously stated several times that he was facing no corruption case; however, the closing of an investigation against him negated his earlier claims. The NAB had included Dar's case in the list of 179 mega-corruption cases since 2001. It was reported that the case was closed due to "immense pressure" from within the NAB or from the federal government despite the fact that enough evidence was available against Dar for a conviction.Dar was disqualified to hold the office of Minister of Finance on 28 July 2017 by the Supreme Court of Pakistan after then-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was also disqualified by the same court following a decision in the Panama Papers case.

He was removed from the chairmanship of major policymaking bodies such as the Economic Coordination Committee and the Council of Common Interests. On 20 August 2017 he was removed from the chairmanship of some 35 National Assembly committees by Shahid Khaqan Abbasi thus further reducing Dar's influence. It was noted that the move to limit Dar to the Ministry of Finance only was made at the direction of the Sharif family. In September 2017 a NAB court in Pakistan indicted Dar in the Panama Papers corruption case for having wealth beyond his known sources of income, but, despite criticism from the opposition parties, he continued to serve as finance minister. In October 2017 he fell ill while in Saudi Arabia and left for the United Kingdom for medical treatment.In November 2017 the court issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for him while he was in London for not appearing in court. It was reported that he may lose his ministerial portfolio due to the corruption case against him on the grounds that he has become ineffective and unable to carry out the responsibilities of a Minister.

Amid the rumors that he had already resigned from the ministerial office due to pressure and criticism, he on 22 November vacated the ministerial office of Finance after taking a medical leave His cabinet portfolio of Finance Minister was withdrawn however, he continued to remain a member of the federal cabinet as a federal minister without portfolio. It was noted that Dar has refused to leave the Finance Ministry and that he took a temporary medical leave for three months after which he may retook the office upon his return to Pakistan.
