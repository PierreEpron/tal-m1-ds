Kasack was born in Potsdam as the only child of a doctor, he studied from 1914 to 1920 national economics and history of literature at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin.In 1915, he published his first poem in the magazine Die Aktion. Two years later, a lifelong friendship began with both the painter Walter Gramatté, the model for the painter Catell in Die Stadt hinter dem Strom, and the poet Oskar Loerke. In 1918, he released a volume of poems, entitled Der Mensch. Verse, which was his first published book.
He started working as a literary editor in 1920 in the publishing house Gustav-Kiepenheuer-Verlag in Potsdam, where he edited the complete works of Friedrich Hölderlin. From 1925, he worked for the Funk-Stunde Berlin. His drama Die Schwester was premiered in 1926. He was director at the S. Fischer Verlag until 1927. On 28 March 1933, he was prohibited from working for any broadcast.
In 1941, he succeeded Oskar Loerke as literary editor in the S. Fischer Verlag, and took consequently over the direction of the publishing house when Peter Suhrkamp was arrested from 1944.
His most famous novel, Die Stadt hinter dem Strom (The city beyond the river) appeared in 1947, for which he was awarded the Fontane Prize of the city of Berlin two years later. A 1957 review stated:But it took the extraordinary event of 1947, the publication of his first novel, Die Stadt hinter dem Strom, to catapult his name into the literary limelight and lift it to true prominence. In 1948, Kasack was a founding member of the German PEN center. He was from 1953 to 1963 the president of the Deutsche Akademie für Sprache und Dichtung. He wrote a libretto for an opera Die Stadt hinter dem Strom, which was composed by Hans Vogt and premiered at the Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden in 1955 as part of the Internationale Maifestspiele Wiesbaden. In 1956, he was awarded the Goethe-Plakette des Landes Hessen.
