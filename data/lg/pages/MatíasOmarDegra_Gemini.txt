After the game ended he had a very serious confrontation with the team's major shareholder Alexis Kougias at the entrance of the locker rooms. Kougias blamed him for having unprofessional behavior and poor performance. Also he claimed to have full responsibility for the second goal the team conceded, when he tried to dribble past 2 opponents, he lost the ball and the other team scored in an empty goal. Photos published later show Kougias hit Degra in the face. Hours later he solved his contract and left the club by mutual agreement.
