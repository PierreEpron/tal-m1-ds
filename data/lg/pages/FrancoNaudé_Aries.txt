He scored eleven tries during the regular season – he scored two tries in matches against Sharks U21, Western Province U19 and Leopards and one try against Leopards U21 and Free State U19 before getting a hat-trick in their final match of the regular season in a 49–26 victory over top-of-the-table Eastern Province U19 to help the Blue Bulls secure second place on the log. He didn't score in their 30–29 victory over Western Province U19 in the semi-final or their 23–25 defeat to Eastern Province U19 in the final, but finished as his team's top try scorer, and second overall in Group A of the competition log behind the Leopards U21s' Zweli Silaule.In March 2016, he was included in a South Africa Under-20 training squad, and made the cut in a reduced provisional squad a week later.He was also named in the Blue Bulls squad for the 2016 Currie Cup qualification series and he made his first class debut on 8 April 2016, starting in their 16–30 defeat to Western Province in Round One of the competition, also starting their 17–38 defeat to Gauteng rivals the Golden Lions a fortnight later.On 10 May 2016, he was included in the final South Africa Under-20 squad for the 2016 World Rugby Under 20 Championship tournament to be held in Manchester in England.
