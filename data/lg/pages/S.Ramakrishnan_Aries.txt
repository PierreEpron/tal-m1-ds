== Writing career ==
About his first book he says: "I was not a writer when my first book 'veLiyil oruvan' was published. Until then I was just writing whatever I wanted to write, but I was not a writer; even after my first book came out…" and "…but now I know the direction, purpose and strength of the written word. I didn’t know that then. It is like how a child with a camera takes pictures of whatever she sees… I was like that child."His short stories and articles have been translated and published in English, Malayalam, Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Kannada and French.
His novel Upa Paandavam, written after a deep research into Mahabharata, was selected as the best novel in Tamil. It was widely well received by the readers.

His short stories are noted for their modern story-telling style in Tamil. He says in an interview: "As a storyteller, it’s vital that I observe people, their mannerisms and keep myself aware of present trends…” and “…I keep myself surrounded by youngsters who I learn a lot from. I think it is such company that keeps me revitalised to write more and more stories".He explains the magical nature of his stories quite simply – "The reason why my stories have a magical aspect is because I am unable to separate Magic from Realism."
