Poveda was shot to death in Tonacatepeque, El Salvador on September 2, 2009; probably by a member of a mara. He was 52 years old.It is alleged that certain police and gang members were unhappy with Poveda's documentary. He had promised his subjects that La Vida Loca would not be released in El Salvador, but he was powerless to prevent pirated copies from being sold. In 2011, ten gang members and a former police officer were convicted and sent to prison for Poveda's death.French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner praised Poveda's work, calling him "a respected journalist, a professional who never hesitated to take great risks in the name of freedom of information." Salvadoran Public Safety Minister Manuel Melgar said Poveda's killing was a "repugnant and reproachable criminal act".
