Born in Zermatt, Valais, Aufdenblatten made her World Cup debut in March 2000 in a giant slalom at Sestriere. She scored four podium finishes on the World Cup: one win in a super-G in Val-d'Isère in December 2009, and three third places in downhill at Haus im Ennstal (2004), Bad Kleinkirchheim (2006), and Lenzerheide (2014).
