=== Hla’alua and Kanakanvu tribes recognition ===
Speaking at Legislative Yuan plenary session in February 2014, Lin said that the Hla’alua and Kanakanvu tribe of Taiwanese aborigines can be recognized as the 15th and 16th aboriginal tribes, stating that those two groups are still currently treated as part of the Tsou group of Kaohsiung.


=== Declining of the aboriginal language use ===
In August 2014, Lin voiced his concern with the declining usage of Taiwan aboriginal languages among the Taiwanese aborigines. He called on the aborigines to put more efforts to reviving their languages, warning that ethnic groups would vanish soon after their languages disappear. He made the remarks after a survey done on the Amis, Bunun, Nataoran, Puyuma, Saisiyat and Thao languages. The survey also revealed that Puyuma language would be added to the endangered languages list.
