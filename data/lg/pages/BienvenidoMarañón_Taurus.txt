Born in Spain, Bienve played in the lower leagues of his birth country. In 2015, moved to the Philippines to sign with United City, then known as Ceres–Negros, playing for several years with the Filipino club. In 2021, he received Filipino citizenship, enabling him to play for the Philippines national team.


== Early life ==
Bienve was born in El Puerto de Santa María, Province of Cádiz, Andalusia, and grew up in neighbouring Cádiz. He spent his childhood playing football in the streets, as his parents could not afford to send him to an academy.

=== Spain ===
Bienve made his senior debut when he was in Spain with local club CD Rayo Sanluqueño in the 2005–06 season. In the third quarter of 2007 he signed with Cádiz CF, being assigned to the reserves in Tercera División.
On December 2, 2007, Bienve appeared in his first game as a professional, coming on as a late substitute in a 3–1 home win against Racing de Ferrol in the Segunda División. He totalled 58 minutes for the first team, who were eventually relegated.
On April 7, 2010, Bienve was released by Cádiz due to indiscipline. He joined fourth-level club Villarrubia CF 14 days later, and scored a career-best 21 goals during the campaign.
Bienve moved to fellow league team CD Móstoles in the 2011 off-season, returning to Villarrubia the following transfer window and subsequently resuming his career in the fourth tier, where he represented La Hoya Lorca CF and UD Socuéllamos. With the latter, he achieved promotion to Segunda División B in 2014.

On May 14, 2015, Bienve moved abroad for the first time in his career, after agreeing a deal with Filipino United Football League side Ceres FC. He was encouraged by former Cádiz teammate Carli de Murga to play for them as early as 2012. After one month at the club, he was not satisfied with his performance and decided to study Chieffy Caligdong's style of play in a bid to improve himself.Bienve considered retiring in 2016 due to the death of his father, but was encouraged by coach Risto Vidaković to continue playing football. He became the all-time top scorer in the AFC Cup on 11 March 2020, when he scored his 35th goal in the renamed Ceres–Negros's 4–0 win against Bali United FC.Ceres–Negros was taken over by a new management in July 2020, being renamed United City FC.

In September, bills were filed in the House of Representatives proposing the same. Those were approved on February 16, 2021, while the corresponding Senate bill was approved on March 15. On July 2, Marañón became a Filipino citizen when the bill was signed into law as Republic Act No. 11570 by President Rodrigo Duterte.Marañón was first called up to play for the Philippine national team for the 2020 AFF Championship, which was postponed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
