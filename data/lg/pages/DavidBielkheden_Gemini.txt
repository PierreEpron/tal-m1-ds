== Mixed martial arts career ==
Bielkheden went 1-2 in UFC and was released from the UFC following his submission loss (rear-naked choke) to Mark Bocek at UFC 97 and has since held a record of 13-5. Right now is Bielkheden riding a 9 fight win streak.


=== Superior Challenge ===
On October 29, 2010 Bielkheden fought Daniel Acácio for the Superior Challenge Welterweight Championship at Superior Challenge 6. He lost the fight via split decision. Bielkheden later failed his post fight drug test following the defeat and was given a 2-year suspension by the Doping Tribunal on April 29, 2011. Additionally, Bielkheden’s loss was changed to a disqualification. Bielkheden initially tested positive for methylhexaneamine, a stimulant often used as a nasal decongestant. The fighter found out about his positive test by mail when he returned from a trip from Canada shortly after the bout. He then paid out of pocket to have his “B” sample tested in hopes that a different result would be found. That was not the case, as Bielkheden found out in December 2010 that his second screen was also flagged for the banned substance, which was added to the World Anti-Doping Agency's prohibited list in 2009. Bielkheden called it a case of “accidental doping” and has pointed to a nasal spray he took a few weeks prior to the bout or food supplements as the probable cause of this substance showing up in tests. In a statement to his fans on his blog, Bielkheden asserts that he had cooperated with the Swedish Doping Tribunal and had been given the go-ahead to fight at Superior Challenge 7 on three separate occasions. Bielkheden was reportedly told the tribunal would hand down judgment for his positive test during the first week of May. However, his punishment was delivered a bit sooner than expected. "The punishment I have been awarded is far too long,” he wrote. “I will spend all my energy, time and money to contest this decision and get this sentence shortened.”
