== Early life and career ==

José Yulo Yulo was born on September 24, 1894 in Bago, Negros Occidental to Sofronio Yulo and Segunda Yulo. He obtained his Bachelor of Laws degree at the University of the Philippines and placed third in the Philippine Bar Examination of 1913; however, due to his age, did not practice law until two years later. He became distinguished as one of the best corporation lawyers in the Philippines.
Appointed as Justice Secretary by Governor-General Frank Murphy and President Manuel L. Quezon in 1934 and 1935, he was elected to the National Assembly of the Philippines representing the province of Negros Occidental, becoming its Speaker under the ruling Nacionalista Party on its convening session in 1939.
The 1935 Philippine Constitution was amended in 1940 changing the unicameral legislature system into a bicameral system; thus the National Assembly was divided into a Senate and a House of Representatives. Yulo remained as Speaker of the National Assembly.
Yulo was elected to the Senate in 1941 for the 1st Congress of the Commonwealth of the Philippines but did not serve immediately as he was arrested by the US Army's Counter-Intelligence Corps (CIC) because he had worked in various capacities under the Japanese-sponsored Philippine Government. Following the Japanese conquest of the Philippines in 1942, he became a member of the Preparatory Committee for Philippine Independence, and upon the establishment of the Second Philippine Republic in 1943, was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. He is the only former Speaker of the House of Representatives of the Philippines to be subsequently appointed Chief Justice. He finally served his elected Senate term in 1945, lasting until 1946.


== Accomplishments ==
Despite the difficulties experienced under Japanese occupation, Yulo attempted to maintain the integrity of the judiciary despite pressure from the Japanese military to sway in decisions on certain cases.


== Postwar years ==
Yulo was the presidential candidate of the Liberal Party in the 1957 presidential election, eventually losing to incumbent President Carlos P. Garcia. His running mate, Pampanga's 1st district representative Diosdado Macapagal, won the vice-presidential race.
Yulo was later appointed by President Ferdinand Marcos as Secretary of Justice, and served from January 1, 1966 to August 4, 1967.


== Death ==
Yulo died of respiratory failure as a result of atherosclerosis at Makati Medical Center in Makati at 10:10 AM on October 27, 1976. He was buried in Canlubang, Calamba, Laguna on October 30, 1976.
