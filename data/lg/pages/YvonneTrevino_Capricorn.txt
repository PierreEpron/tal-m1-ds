Yvonne Trevino (born 18 January 1967), is an Arizona Native and former Women's kickboxing and boxing champion from Peoria, Arizona, United States.


== Background ==
Trevino was popular among boxing and kickboxing fans during the 1990s, especially in the Southwestern United States and in her native home state of Arizona. Her popularity led her to have a loyal following as well. Trevino modeled the meaning of dedication and discipline along with the desire to succeed through the Martial Arts discipline and Women's Boxing.
Trevino grew up the third child in a family of four. As children for entertainment, they would always come up with outdoor activities that were often sports challenges and physical obstacle courses that kept them actively competing with each other around the home. Trevino's athletic potential was noticed early by her fourth-grade school teacher Ms. Gehring (Phoenix Suns Photographer), who encouraged Trevino to ask her parents' permission to stay after school and participate in sports. Trevino said being involved in sports was a good turning point in her life it kept her focused, disciplined, and out of trouble. Growing up Trevino had known about her Uncle Frank Rojo and her Cousin Alex Rojo both having Amateur Boxing careers. As well as her cousins Robert Vasquez and Sensei Larry Vasquez running Valley Kenpo Karate Martial Arts gym. Trevinoâ€™s family members Aunt Lucina Trevino Diaz and her Brother Sal Trevino had personal influence throughout her career.
Married young while attending college on an athletic scholarship, Trevino unexpectedly became a divorced single parent, then later a serious custody battle over her daughter. As a single working parent, Trevino watched a women's match on TV and was intent on mastering a new physical challenge. She talked her way into some pretty tough gyms. On one occasion a head trainer matched Trevino with an advanced fighter who was told to go hard on her. When the fighter exposed an opening Trevino said she got the living air kicked out of her. It took all her strength to stand back up gasping for air, regain her composure and not walk out defeated. It convinced Trevino to work harder on strategy and improve her defense. Later impressed with her courage the same gym owner offered her a fight contract where the percentage taken was not going to be in her best interest (without any sponsorships or endorsements, or financial backing), nothing in comparison to the lucrative contacts of today. While most gyms were preparing guys for the golden gloves competitions with dreams of Olympic gold medals and future lucrative professional boxing careers. Trevino could only imagine the possibilities for women to display their pugilist talent, not only in competing but training others, who love to stay in shape.
Trevino searched for training that was diverse in both hand skills and kickboxing styles. She began training at Fairtex Muay Thai Camp in Chandler Arizona under fighters/trainers, such as Wayne Gregory, Burnkerd Faphimai, Phicheat Arunleung, Chris Cariaso, and Sky Sithbunkerd. While training vigorously and competing in both Muay Thai Kickboxing and Boxing events, Trevino earned her first WIBF flyweight World Boxing title and later the IMTO International Muay Thai Kickboxing title. Trevino said it was the best time in her early career to be working with such a diverse fight team. After several years the Fairtex Muay Thai Camp unexpectedly closed its doors. Despite the struggle to continue training and staying in Arizona to address a personal court custody battle, Trevino choose to commute to Las Vegas and trained briefly under both Jeff and Roger Mayweather at The United Champions Gym. This prepared her for the ABC Wide World of Sports WIBF title defense against Brenda Rouse. Now in a contract dispute with a Las Vegas manager, Trevino found herself in another legal battle to have the contract severed. Taking several fight purses to recoup her finances Trevino moved forward.
In the mid and into late 1990s there were several factors that plagued women fighters over the years, the lack of lucrative payouts made it impossible for women fighters to pursue their passion for the sport. The lack of mainstream media exposure made most fighters unknown to the general public and without marketing endorsements. Trevino found herself in a struggle to focus while continuing to pursue her passion in Boxing and Kickboxing matches, working a full-time job, and defending her personal court battles took its toll and she found herself losing several world titles. Trevino felt if she could not apply herself 100% then retirement was obvious. After having spent nearly ten years in the fight arena. Trevino can confidently look back and is extremely proud of being not only a pioneer in the fight industry but an inductee of the International Womens Boxing Hall of Fame.
