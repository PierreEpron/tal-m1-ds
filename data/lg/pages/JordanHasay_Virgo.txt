=== High school ===


==== Freshman year ====
Hasay attended Mission College Preparatory Catholic High School, a private Roman Catholic high school in San Luis Obispo, California. She set the all-time freshman record at the 2005 Mt. SAC Cross Country Invitational. Hasay won the 2005 Foot Locker Cross Country Championships race with a time of 17:05 over five kilometers, being the second freshman to win this race and with the fastest winning time since 2001. She won the 3200 meter race at the 2006 CIF California State Meet with a time of 10:13.55 and won the mile race at the 2006 Golden West Invitational with a time of 4:42.21, just 0.21 seconds off the high school freshman mile record of 4:42.0 set by Mary Decker in 1973. She also won the 3000 meter race at the 2006 USATF Junior (19-and-under) Championship Track & Field Meet with a time of 9:50.66. Normally, the winner of this race would have qualified to represent the U.S. at the 2006 World Junior Championship Track & Field Meet in Beijing, China, but at age 14, Hasay was too young according to the rules of the International Association of Athletics Federations.
Hasay lost just two races in her freshman year: her first cross country race in the fall of 2005 when she did not finish, and the Nike Outdoor Nationals mile, where she placed third with a time of 4:42.27, three seconds behind junior Danielle Tauro. She was selected by Track & Field News magazine as the third best high school miler, second best high school two-miler, and the seventeenth best overall girls high school track and field athlete in the U.S. for 2006.


==== Sophomore year ====
Hasay won the 2007 USATF Junior Cross Country Championship race in a time of 21:44 over six kilometers, leading from the beginning and winning by 14 seconds. She qualified to represent the US at the 2007 World Cross Country Championships in Mombasa, Kenya on March 24, but because of a terrorism warning at the meet, she did not participate.Hasay set the age 15 and national high school sophomore class records in the 3200m in her first race on the track in 2007 with a time of 10:04.52, the fastest high school time since 2004. She won the 3200 meter race at the 2007 CIF California State Meet in a time of 10:06.76 and won the mile race at the 2007 Golden West Invitational in a time of 4:43.34. Hasay also won the 1500 meter race at the 2007 USATF Junior Championship Track & Field Meet in a meet record time of 4:16.98. This was the fourth fastest HS 1500 of all time, the fastest ever by a US 15-year-old, fastest ever by a sophomore (eclipsed on June 1, 2012 by Mary Cain's 4:16.52), and the fastest HS time in 25 years. She received a silver medal in her first international championships, running a 4:17.24 in the 1500 meters at the 5th IAAF World Youth Championships in Ostrava, Czech Republic, finishing behind the 4:15.47 run by Sammary Cherotich of Kenya.Hasay was selected by Track and Field News magazine as both the best high school miler and two-miler in 2007 (the first girls mile/2-mile double winner since Julia Stamps in 1997), and also the 5th best overall (and top sophomore) girls high school track and field athlete in the United States for 2007.


==== Junior year ====
Hasay won the USATF Cross Country Championships Junior Women's 6K on February 16, 2008 in 20 minutes, 32 seconds at Mission Bay Park in San Diego.
Hasay's determination to win was illustrated in the All Star meeting between her and Christine Babcock at the Arcadia Invitational. In that race, both runners would not concede, turning the race into a rare home stretch sprint challenge for Hasay. As a traditional frontrunner, this was not thought to be Hasay's strength, but she held off Babcock to win. This race served as a precursor for the challenge in the CIF State meet Finals.
At the 2008 CIF California State Meet on May 31, Hasay held off Davis Senior High School senior Laurynne Chetelat down the home stretch to win her third consecutive 3200 state title in a meet record of 9:52.13, the second fastest 3200 time run by a high school girl ever (only behind Kim Mortensen's National Record) and the first (along with Chetelat) under 10 minutes since Caitlin Chock in 2004. She successfully defended her national junior 1500m title on June 22.
After having finished her junior year in June, the 16-year-old Hasay postponed her departure for the World IAAF Junior Championships in order to compete in the Olympic Trials and to attempt to lower the high school 1500 record. On July 2, she ran the quarterfinals at the University of Oregon's Hayward Field, in Eugene, advancing to the semifinals. On July 4, she came from behind in the stretch, breaking the national high school record for 1500m and qualifying her for the Trials finals. As she finished, thousands of spectators in the partisan crowd chanted, "Go to Oregon." Her time of 4:14.50 bested the previous mark, held by Christine Babcock, by 1.92 seconds. Hasay's time was also the record for the combined all-time (converted) US high school 1500/1600/mile events, as maintained by Track & Field News.Hasay closed out her 2008 track season on July 13 in Bydgoszcz, Poland by finishing fourth in the 1500m at the IAAF World Junior Championships in a time of 4:19.02. This finish was the best ever for a U.S. girl in the World Juniors women's 1500m.
Hasay was named the 2008 USA Track and Field's Youth Athlete of the Year on October 21. On October 23, Track & Field News announced that their voting panel unanimously selected Hasay the 2008 Girls High School Athlete of the Year.


==== Senior year ====
Hasay's senior year cross country season included her fourth straight California high school Division V win, making her the second athlete in California state history, after Sara Hall (née Bei), to win four state titles. (A third female, Sarah Baxter of Simi Valley High School, has since also won four California state cross country titles.) Hasay then went on to win her fourth straight Foot Locker West Regional title, becoming the first athlete in the history of the Foot Locker National meet to win a regional title four times. Finally, she won the national Foot Locker Cross Country Championships for the second time, in a time of 17:22. This win makes her the sixth runner to win this prestigious meet twice, and the only athlete to win the meet in non-consecutive years. She decided not to defend her USA Cross Country Championships Junior Women's 6K title.
Hasay won Arcadia Invitational, CIF SS, CIF Masters, CIF State titles in track and field. Hasay won the two-mile at the 2009 Nike Indoor Nationals with a time 10:10.89, making her the sixth fastest U.S. high school performer of all time in her first indoor race. Hasay was named the 2008-9 MaxPreps Female Athletes of the Year.In February 2009, Hasay committed to the Oregon Ducks over many other prestigious programs.

This led Oregon to win the Indoor title for the first time in school history. The DMR time at this meet (10:58.96) was a school record and only the second time Oregon women had run under 11:00.
Hasay's collegiate outdoor debut was a memorable one as she won the featured section of the 1500m at the Stanford Invitational in 4:14.67, which was less than a quarter of a second off her PR, as well as the junior national high school record, that she set at the 2008 Olympic Trials. In her Hayward Field debut as a Duck, she won the 5000m to help Oregon win the Pepsi Team Invitational.
