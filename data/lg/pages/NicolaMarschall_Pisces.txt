During this time he briefly returned to Germany to further his art technique.Mary Clay Lockett, wife of prominent Marion attorney Napoleon Lockett, requested of Marschall to take part in the competition to create a new flag to represent the Confederate States of America.

During the Civil War, Marschall served in the Second Regiment of Confederate Engineer Troops, under Samuel Lockett.  After the war, he returned to Marion and married Martha Eliza Marshall.During his career, Marschall painted portraits of Jefferson Davis, Abraham Lincoln, Otto von Bismarck, various Southern families, and Confederate and Union soldiers. He was one of the few who was able to have Nathan Bedford Forrest pose for him. Additionally, he did many landscapes and religious paintings.
