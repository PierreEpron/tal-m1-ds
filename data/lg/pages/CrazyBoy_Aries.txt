== Biography ==


=== International Wrestling Revolution Group (1997-2006) ===
Around the turn of the millennium, Crazy Boy worked extensively in Naucalpan, Mexico State, for the then recently created International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG). In IWRG he formed a "suicidal" trio with Star Boy and Súper Boy who all used a high flying, high risk wrestling style.


=== Consejo Mundial De Lucha Libre (2006) ===
Crazy Boy's stint in CMLL ended in a messy way, with Crazy pulling himself out from an Arena Mexico show (which would have been his first CMLL one there), claiming an injury from a just completed Japanese tour, only to show up as a surprise days later.


=== Asistencia Asesoria y Adminitracion (2007–Present) ===
He won the AAA promoted "Campeonato National de Atomico" (4 man tag team championship), along with Juventud Guerrera, Joe Líder and Psicosis II. After Psicosis II's betrayal costing the Mexican Powers' their titles, Extreme Tiger was brought in as a replacement. Tiger has left the group since to join Halloween's new group, as it remains Crazy Boy, Joe Líder, and Juventud Guerrera. Along with Joe Líder and Juventud Guerrera, the group traveled to Japan to compete in Pro Wrestling Noah's TripleSEM, where they were victorious. Crazy Boy and Joe Líder thought still remain AAA World Tag Team Championship.
Joe Líder broke off his connection to Mexican Powers, losing his and Crazy Boy's AAA World Tag Team Championship to the Halloween and Extreme Tiger. After Líder's leave, Crazy Boy, Juventud Guerrera, and Ultimo Gladiador continued as the Mexican Powers, while Líder formed a new group with Psicosis. When Juventud departed, Crazy Boy and Ultimo Gladiador continued to compete as a two-man tag team. Some months after Dr. Wagner, Jr. joined AAA, Ultimo Gladiador became a part of the Wagnermaniacos faction, leaving Crazy Boy on his own.
Crazy Boy returned to AAA in 2013 to reform Mexican Powers with Joe Líder. On June 16 at Triplemanía XXI, the two won a five-way match for the vacant AAA World Tag Team Championship.


=== Desastre Total Ultraviolento (2004–Present) ===
In 2004, Crazy Boy founded his own wrestling organization, Desastre Total Ultraviolento. On September 27, 2007, he teamed with El Generico to defeat Zema Ion and Extreme Tiger. On November 16, 2007, Crazy Boy defeated Zema Ion and Extreme Tiger in a three-way Light Tube match.
