He stepped down as leader on October 25, 2010 after failing to win a seat in the 2010 general election. On November 2, 2010, Duguay further announced that he would be leaving the NDP altogether because of what he called "feuding" between party members and "outsiders" who had been brought in to run the election campaign.Duguay was a 2018 Quebec general election candidate for the New Democratic Party of Quebec in the Quebec City provincial electoral district of Taschereau.
