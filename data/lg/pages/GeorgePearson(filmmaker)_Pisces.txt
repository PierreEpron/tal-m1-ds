== Biography ==
The only son of George Pearson, a silk tie cutter, George Pearson's first profession after Culham College, near Oxford (not a college of the University of Oxford) was teaching. He excelled in this role, becoming a headmaster by 1902 at the age of 26. His major post was at Staples Rd School Loughton Essex, on which there is a blue plaque. He was originally drawn to film making as an educational aid. In 1913 Pearson entered the film industry, initially as a script writer.
Pearson worked for Gaumont and later joined the Colonial Film Unit (later the Commonwealth Film Unit), remaining in employment until the age of 81. Though little of his work is known to have survived, Pearson is credited with pioneering the use of the moving camera shot.
