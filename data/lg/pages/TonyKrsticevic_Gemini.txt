He joined the Liberal Party in 1995, in 2008 he was asked to nominate for Carine after the incumbent member, Katie Hodson-Thomas, announced her retirement.His parliamentary maiden speech referred to his Catholic beliefs, and was identified by Amanda O'Brien of the Australian newspaper as part of a four-member "god squad" in WA politics.After the 2017 election defeat of the Barnett Government he became a contender to lead the parliamentary Liberal party from opposition.He was voted out at the 2021 state election with a 12.7% swing against him, being replaced with Labor's Paul Lilburne. Prior to that election, Carine was considered a safe Liberal seat and very unlikely to go to Labor.In October 2021, Krsticevic was elected with a four-year term to the Coastal Ward of the City of Stirling council.
