Her main Australian triathlon rival in the 1990s, Emma Carney, said: "Jackie was a perfectionist[,] and I think perhaps Jackie never really appreciated – or realised – all that she achieved. It wasn't just the races she won, or the sports she excelled in – Jackie was a pioneer in Australian triathlon coaching and administration."
Emma Snowsill, 2008 Beijing Olympics Women's Triathlon gold medalist, commented that "You shared and cared in your knowledge and passion for our sport more than anyone[,] Jackie Fairweather. “Not only a hero for your athletic abilities, but your generosity to help many up-and-coming athletes to pave a way for themselves and the future of the sport is second to none…" Snowsill was a member of Fairweather's Australian Institute of Sport triathlon squad.
Her Memorial Service was held at the AIS Arena with more than 600 people attending. The location was apt, as it was where Jackie worked for 13 years and met her husband Simon.
