Her family's chocolate factory was founded by her ancestors in 1796, and calls itself the first chocolate-making company in Italy.

She became vice president, with her son Francesco Mezzadri Majani, who she called "brother" because they were so close in age. Her son took care of the finances while Majani designed dozens of new shapes, textures and packages for their chocolate collections. She turned her family's chocolates into design objects, and added charisma to the company's brand.Majani died in Bologna on 28 February 2021, aged 85, of COVID-19.
