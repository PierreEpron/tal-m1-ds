=== 2008 Australian Open campaign ===
Aged 32, Sirianni kicked off his Australian Open campaign with the wildcard playoffs. The 16 player round-robin style tournament consisted of 4 groups. Sirianni was placed within the likes of Colin Ebelthite, Andrew Coelho and Greg Jones. Sirianni topped the group without dropping a set, and he booked a semifinal match against Brydan Klein. Sirianni continued his run with a 6–4, 6–3 win, seeing him through to the final against Adam Feeney. Sirianni defeated Feeney 6–3, 4–6, 6–3, 6–4, earning Sirianni a wildcard into the 2008 Australian Open. Joe was drawn against Serbia's Janko Tipsarević in the first round of the 2008 Australian Open. Tipsarevic ranked No.47 in the ATP rankings was roughly 100 places higher than Sirianni. Joe pushed the Serb to five sets but eventually lost 5–7 2–6 7–6(6) 6–0 0–6.


=== Sirianni's run in 2008 AO Series ===
Sirianni also competed for a spot in the main draw of the 2008 Next Generation Adelaide International wildcard playoffs. Sirianni was seeded number two in the 8-player knockout-style tournament. Sirianni again defeated Andrew Coehlo and Greg Jones, thus qualifying for the final. Sirianni upset Alun Jones, the top seed, 4–6, 6–3, [10–5], in a match tiebreak. Siranni therefore earned a wildcard to the Adelaide tournament. Prior to Adelaide, Sirianni had only won one ATP match when he entered the tournament. Sirianni was a regular on the Challenger tour who had come off from back-to-back title wins in Caloundra and Brisbane with 15 wins out of 16 matches. Sirianni's first round match was against Adelaide's fifth seed, who was the injured world number 30 Radek Štěpánek. Sirianni led 7–6 (3), 4–3, before Stepanek retired. Taking his second ATP win, Joseph met Sam Querrey in the second round, where Sirianni recorded a maiden ATP quarter final with a 6–7(5), 6–2, 6–3 win. In the quarter-finals Sirianni met second seed and world No. 25 Paul-Henri Mathieu of France. Joseph prevailed in a tight third set tie-break to win 1–6 6–1 7–6(6) and book a place in the semi-finals. Sirianni's fairytale run ended succumbing against Michaël Llodra 6–3, 7–6(8). However, Sirianni's efforts earned him a special entry to the Medibank International and heralded the nickname 'Aussie Joe'. Sirianni was unable to continue his run, succumbing against qualifier Steve Darcis 1–6, 6–7(4).


=== After 2008 AO Series ===
