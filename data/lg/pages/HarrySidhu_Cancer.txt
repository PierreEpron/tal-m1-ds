Per an affidavit by FBI Special Agent Brian Adkins, Sidhu is under investigation for having violated numerous federal statutes. These potential violations include: honest services fraud, theft or bribery concerning programs receiving federal funds, wire fraud, mail fraud, false statements, obstruction of justice, and witness tampering. The release of this information prompted the State of California Attorney General Rob Bonta to suspend a pending settlement with the City of Anaheim regarding the Angel Stadium sale.On May 16, 2022, a court filing by the California Superior Court, County of Orange, stated that Sidhu is under investigation by the FBI and an Orange County Grand Jury for potential criminal conduct related to the sale of the Angel Stadium property, and for his actions related to the registering of a personal aircraft at a false out-of-state address. The sale of Angel Stadium and its land for $320 million to the Anaheim Angels is alleged to have violated state law, specifically the Surplus Land Act, which requires public agencies to prioritize affordable housing, parks, and open space when they sell public property. Furthermore, it is alleged that he provided confidential information to the Angels, and hoped to solicit $1 million in campaign contributions from the team.
