On 3 January 2011, Rossini was again loaned to Sassuolo for the remainder of the 2010–11 season, where he appeared in 18 league matches Serie B.Rossini returned to Sampdoria for the 2011–12 season under manager Giuseppe Iachini. He made his Sampdoria debut on 19 November 2011 against Reggina, where he helped earn Sampdoria promotion to Serie A after they won the Serie B play-offs.
After promotion to Serie A, under new manager Ciro Ferrara, Rossini was first-choice centre-back alongside captain Daniele Gastaldello at the heart of the defence. Rossini's first Serie A match was against Milan on 26 August 2012. After the arrival of new manager Delio Rossi, Rossini lost his place in the team after Angelo Palombo returned from Internazionale and was played regularly at centre-back, at Rossini's expense. In total, Rossini made 25 Serie A appearances in the 2012–13 season.
On 20 June – 1 July 2013, Sassuolo, newly promoted to Serie A, purchased the 50% ownership rights to Rossini held by Udinese for €1.5 million, via Sampdoria. Sampdoria retained the remaining 50% of Rossini's rights.


=== Sassuolo ===
On 1 July 2013, Rossini joined Sassuolo on another co-ownership deal and appeared in six league matches for the first part of the 2013–14 season. However, Sassuolo later signed centre-backs Lorenzo Ariaudo and Paolo Cannavaro during the 2014 January transfer window, limiting Rossini's first-team appearances.


==== Parma (loan) ====
On 21 January 2014, Rossini was loaned out the fellow Serie A club Parma for the remainder of the season, with Aleandro Rosi moving in the opposite direction to Sassuolo, also on loan. Rossini mainly found himself used as the backup at centre-back to Italian international Gabriel Paletta and club captain Alessandro Lucarelli. Parma finished the season in sixth position and qualified for Europe. However, because Parma was ineligible to qualify for European competitions, Torino was given their place in the UEFA Europa League.
On 20 June 2014, Sampdoria relinquished the Rossini's remaining 50% rights to Sassuolo for free.


==== Bari (loan) ====
On 11 July 2014, after Rossini began training with English Championship club Leeds United, Leeds owner Massimo Cellino revealed the club was looking to sign Rossini on a year-long loan with the option to make the move permanent. However, on 13 July, Leeds opted to abandon the deal due to concerns of Rossini's lack of fitness, and the player returned to Sassuolo. Cellino said, "We want special players at Leeds United. Rossini didn't show enough during the three days he trained with the rest of the team. After speaking to him, it is clear that he didn't have the right attitude to join Leeds, so we have allowed him to leave."On 17 July 2014, Rossini joined Serie B club Bari on loan from Sassuolo.


==== Savona (loan) ====
On 17 July 2015, Rossini was signed by Lega Pro club Savona on a temporary deal from Sassuolo.
