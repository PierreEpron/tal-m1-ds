During the Great Vermont Flood on November 2, 1927, Jackson's car stalled after he hit a deep hole while attempting to drive through the rising Potash Brook near his home at Nelson and Tremont Streets in Barre.  According to a witness, Jackson's hat and glasses were knocked off, and he appeared dazed.  He began walking towards his house, and water rushing fast enough to cut a channel across Nelson Street (then a dirt road) carried him away.  Those nearby attempted unsuccessfully to save him, as did a Vermont National Guard detachment.  He drowned, and the next day his body was recovered from the Potash approximately a mile from where he was last seen.

Jackson was buried in the family plot of William Wells at Lakeview Cemetery in Burlington. Hollister Jackson was the brother of H. Nelson Jackson, who was married to Wells's daughter Bertha.
