== Cener affair ==
Bandović came into public focus in May 2017, when he refused the bribe of 10,000 KM (around 5000 €) offered by manager Sanel Klopić to "defend less than perfectly" in the upcoming relegation playoff match against NK Metalleghe-BSI from Jajce. Having recorded the conversation on an audio tape, Bandović published it to the media and submitted it to the Football Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bandović later explained he decided to record the conversation after Klopić had approached him several times with the same demand. The Football Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina immediately took over the investigation, eventually submitting it to the national public persecution office. The match against Metalleghe ended up in a 1–1 draw, and both clubs were eventually relegated to the First League of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.Bandović was praised for his role in what became known as the "Cener affair". ("Cener" means tenner, i.e. the ten-thousand figure). In an interview, he stated "I can't do that... I'm 33 now and I don't want a spot on my honour on the end of my career. When I finish my career, I want to turn back and say that I've done my job fairly and honestly".
