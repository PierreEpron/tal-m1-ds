Andrew Prendeville (born October 5, 1981) is an American professional automobile racer.
In 2004, Prendeville took second place in the Cooper Tires Formula Ford 2000 national championship. In 2002, at the Valvoline Runoffs, he won the SCCA Formula Continental national championship, sharing the position as SCCA's Rookie of the Year.

Based in Las Vegas, Prendeville raced in the Indy Pro Series for Andersen Racing from the start of the 2007 season until the middle of the 2008 season. Until departing to "pursue other opportunities", Prendeville drove car No. 5, with signage dedicated to Best Friends Animal Society. In 2007, in coordination with the no-kill animal sanctuary, Prendeville launched "Racing Laps for Best Friends", a fundraising initiative that included a website for donation and promotional appearances. In July 2007, Prendeville was named an honorary citizen of Indianapolis in response to his fundraising efforts. He was replaced in car No. 5 by Daniel Herrington. He returned to the series for 2009, driving for Team Moore Racing. He finished a career-best 9th in points with a best finish of third at Chicagoland Speedway.
A resident of Chatham Township, New Jersey, Prendeville, who graduated from Chatham High School in 2000, is the younger brother of Doug Prendeville, who is also a professional driver.
