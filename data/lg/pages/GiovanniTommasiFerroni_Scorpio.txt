== Biography ==
Ferroni was born into a family of Tuscan artists, including his father Riccardo, grandfather Leone, and uncle Marcello from Pietrasanta. Ferroni's sister Elena was also a painter with whom Ferroni held joint exhibitions early on in his career.
In 1986, after graduating high school, he joined his father's atelier and studied at the Rome University 'La Sapienza'. His paintings depict a fantasy world that is inhabited by all kinds of mythological, historical and contemporary creatures.
