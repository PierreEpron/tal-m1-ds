== Politics ==
In January 2021, Hines announced that he would run as a Republican for the United States House of Representatives in North Carolina's 5th congressional district, held by Republican Virginia Foxx. Once the North Carolina congressional lines were redrawn, Hines switched to run in the open 6th congressional district based in Greensboro, North Carolina, where he spent much of his time campaigning.In February 2022, the North Carolina Supreme Court struck down North Carolinaâ€™s congressional lines, stating they were "unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt." After the North  Carolina district lines were thrown out, Hines switched districts to run in the newly created 13th congressional district which is based in the suburbs of Raleigh. He received the endorsement of former President Donald Trump on March 14, who called Hines a "fighter for Conservative values."In April 2022, local Republicans campaigned against Hines through newspaper advertisements, email blasts, and door-knocking because Hines did not live in the district in which he was running. He lived in Winston-Salem, the heart of the old 5th, but was in the process of moving to Fuquay-Varina in the new 13th. Members of the House are only required to live in the state they represent, but longstanding convention calls for them to live in or close to the district they represent.

Hines said, "This is a Raleigh issue, not a Washington issue." Hines expressed belief that the 2020 election was stolen and promoted voter fraud conspiracy theories.
