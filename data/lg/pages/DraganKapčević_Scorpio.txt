During his time there he got into a car accident where the vehicle flipped over and he got stuck underneath. The prognosis was that his footballing career might be over. However, the next year he made a short, one-game comeback for his old club Anundsjö, where he scored two goals. And then the following year, he made a full return to playing with Sollefteå. There he performed well enough to get noticed by Allsvenskan club Gefle IF, who signed him to a 1.5-year contract.He later played for Östers Växjö.
