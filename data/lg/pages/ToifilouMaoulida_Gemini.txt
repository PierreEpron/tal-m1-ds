Toifilou Maoulida (born 8 June 1979) is a French former professional footballer who played as a striker or as a winger.


== Club career ==
Maoulida was born in Mayotte, a small island in the Indian Ocean, close to the Comoro Islands and Reunion Island, and raised in Marseille.
He started his professional career at Montpellier Hérault Sport Club in 1997. In January 2002, he was transferred to Stade Rennais F.C. After two seasons, coach László Bölöni considered that Maoulida did not fit in any longer with his tactical scheme and he was loaned to Metz, in the east of France. There, he scored 12 goals in 33 matches. After returning to Stade Rennais for the 2004–05 season he scored 7 goals in 31 matches.
In summer 2005, he was transferred to AS Monaco FC on free transfer, where he failed once more. Eventually, he went to Olympique de Marseille where he finally met success reaching the French Cup final in the 2005–06 and 2006–07 seasons and getting the second place in the French League 1 in the 2006–07 season. He played for AJ Auxerre in the 2007–08 season, and joined RC Lens in January 2008, at that time of the bottom three in Ligue 1.
In August 2011, he signed a contract with Ligue 2 side SC Bastia.
In July 2014, he signed a two-year contract with Ligue 2 team Nîmes Olympique.


== International career ==
Given that Comorians consider the Mayotte's people as their own, the country's football federation asked Maoulida to join the Comorian senior team, but he rejected the offer out of respect for the people of his island.
