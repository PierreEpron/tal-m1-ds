She appeared in several films during the 1960s. Her best-known appearance was the role of Bond girl, Patricia Fearing or Pat, a nurse who takes care of James Bond (Sean Connery) while he is on holiday at her health clinic in Thunderball (1965). Peters was the first Bond girl to be seen taking her clothes off on screen in the Bond series.Peters appeared in Playboy, in the November 1965 issue. Her appearance was as part of a pictorial essay titled "James Bond's Girls", by Richard Maibaum.According to the special edition DVD of Thunderball, Peters' short film career was the result of a disagreement between her and her agent. The specifics of the disagreement were not revealed, other than according to Peters, her agent at the time of Thunderball held her to her contract agreement of representation because of the mega-successful box-office hit of the fourth James Bond film in 1965. It was only many years later, when the fame, the glamour and the chaos from the release of Thunderball had faded, that her contractual agreement ended; and so had any modelling and/or film prospects.
