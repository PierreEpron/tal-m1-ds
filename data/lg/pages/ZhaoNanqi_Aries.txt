== Early life ==
Cho Nam-gi (Zhao Nanqi in Mandarin Chinese) was born on 20 April 1927 in Cheongwon County in Korea under Japanese rule (in present-day Cheongju, North Chungcheong Province, South Korea). Because of Japanese colonial policies that required Koreans to use Japanese-style names, he also used the Japanese surname Toyoda (豊田).In 1939, Zhao's family moved to Manchukuo, the Japanese-controlled puppet state in Northeast China, and settled in Yongji County, Jilin Province. When Japan surrendered in 1945 at the end of World War II, Chinese rule was restored in Northeast China and Korea regained its independence. Many Koreans in China returned to Korea, but Zhao's family stayed and was recognized as Chaoxianzu (Chinese of Korean ethnicity). Zhao met General Zhou Baozhong of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, who recruited him into the army and sent him to study at Northeast Military and Political University, where he learned to speak, read and write Chinese. He participated in the land reform movement in Jilin and joined the Communist Party of China in February 1947.


== Korean War ==
When China resolved to intervene in the Korean War in October 1950, Zhao was deployed to Korea because of his proficiency in the Korean language. He served in the logistics department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) alongside Mao Anying, the son of Chairman Mao Zedong. Zhao evacuated the cave where the PVA headquarters were located just before American planes bombed it and killed Mao Anying in November 1950.Zhao distinguished himself during the celebrated Battle of Triangle Hill in October 1952, when the unit under his command braved American aerial bombing and transported 30,000 grenades from Andong, China to the 15th Corps in the front line within 15 hours. He was also responsible for constructing the building in which the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed in 1953.After the armistice, Zhao was sent to study at the PLA Logistics Academy. Because of his wartime experience, he was promoted to become a lecturer at the academy after only one year of study, and was asked to write a report of his experience and lessons learned during the war. In 1957, he was appointed the director of the PVA office overseeing the withdrawal of the Chinese forces from Korea. He left North Korea together with the last PVA troops in 1958. After returning to China, he was received by Mao Zedong and Marshal Zhu De.

When the People's Liberation Army restored military ranks (which had been abolished in 1965) in September 1988, Zhao was among the 17 PLA officers to attain the rank of full general (shang jiang), and the only one from an ethnic minority. From 1992 to 1995, he served as President of the PLA Academy of Military Science.From 1998 to 2003, Zhao served as vice-chairman of the 9th Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee.
