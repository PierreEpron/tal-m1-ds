I went to Auckland Girls Grammar - AGGs (laughs) and when I was 19 I moved to Sydney, Australia and was back and forth to NZ - my family are all still here and are based Central, so it's handy.  
I'm Samoan, Maori, German - my mum's Samoan/German and my dad's Maori.  My mum's family are from the island of Upolu.  My grandmother's from Lufilufi, Lefaga and Saleimoa and my dad's Tainui, which is Waikato."As a youth, Fabian found early success on the athletics track qualifying for the junior Olympics as well as becoming a competitive rower when she lived in Australia.
