Luo Yijun (Chinese: 駱以軍; pinyin: Luò Yǐjūn; born 29 March 1967) is a Taiwanese writer.


== Biography ==
Luo attended Chinese Culture University, where he studied Chinese literature under authors such as Zhang Dachun, who influenced his early style; he later earned a master's degree in theater from Taipei National University of the Arts. His works include fiction, poetry, essays, and literary criticism. He is the recipient of numerous awards including the China Times Literature Award and the 10th United Daily News Literature Prize. In 2007, he was a visiting writer at the Iowa Writers' Workshop.


== Themes and Style ==
The only child of mainland Chinese immigrants who fled the Kuomintang, Luo has attributed the themes of alienation and migration in novels such as Tangut Inn, which combines science fiction with characteristics of postmodern literature, or the quasi-autobiographical vignettes that comprise We, to his own experience of cultural outsiderness growing up in Taiwan. His style has been described by David Der-wei Wang as "pseudo-autobiographical intimate narratives constituting a relay race of fragments, filled with uncanny and decadent imagery and undergirded by an immoral worldview".


== Legacy and Impact ==
Luo's essay collection My Little Boys (小兒子) has been adapted into a play by Huang Zhi-kai of the theater troupe Story Works (故事工廠).Luo's Tangut Inn has been adapted into a play by Wei Ing-chuan (魏瑛娟).Xu Rong-zhe (許榮哲), Taiwanese author of the novel 迷藏 (Mi-Cang), once said that he was influenced by Luo Yijun and Taiwanese author Yuan Zhe-sheng (袁哲生).
