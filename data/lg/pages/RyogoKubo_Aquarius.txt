Ryogo Kubo (久保 亮五, Kubo Ryōgo, February 15, 1920 – March 31, 1995)  was a Japanese mathematical physicist, best known for his works in statistical physics and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.


== Work ==
In the early 1950s, Kubo transformed research into the linear response properties of near-equilibrium condensed-matter systems, in particular the understanding of electron transport and conductivity, through the Kubo formalism, a Green's function approach to linear response theory for quantum systems. In 1977 Ryogo Kubo was awarded the Boltzmann Medal for his contributions to the theory of non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, and to the theory of fluctuation phenomena. He is cited particularly for his work in the establishment of the basic relations between transport coefficients and equilibrium time correlation functions: relations with which his name is generally associated.
