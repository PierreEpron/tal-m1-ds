== Life ==
Koerppen was born in Wiesbaden on 16 December 1926. His father, August Koerppen, was a conductor, so he became familiar with music early. He received his first music lessons at the age of six. While still at school, he wrote his own compositions. He attended the Musisches Gymnasium Frankfurt for especially musically gifted children from all over Germany, from 1939 to 1945; he was trained in composition and music theory by Kurt Thomas. He studied at the same time as Heinz Hennig, Paul Kuhn, Clytus Gottwald and Siegfried Strohbach.After World War II, Koerppen initially worked as an organist and music teacher at the Musisches Gymnasium. In 1946, his first works were published and he received commissions for compositions. In 1948, Koerppen became a lecturer at the Landesmusikschule Hannover, (later the Hochschule für Musik und Theater). When the opera house was reopened after restoration, his oratorio Der Turmbau zu Babel was premiered.Koerppen's opera Virgilius, der Magier von Rom to a libretto by the composer after Virgil was premiered in Frankfurt in 1951, and published by Breitkopf & Härtel in 1953. In 1960, he was granted a one-year scholarship at the Villa Massimo in Rome. In 1967, he was appointed professor of composition and music theory at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater Hannover. Since 1970, he has also been active internationally, teaching for example as a visiting professor at the Shanghai Academy of Music. In 1983, Koerppen received the Lower Saxony State Prize for culture. He retired from teaching in 1991, having educated many students who became notable composers, conductors, church musicians and pedagogues. Koerppen wrote his last work, a cantata In Paradisum (To paradise) to the text from the Requiem, in 2021 at age 94. It was premiered in the Stadthaus Burgdorf in September 2021.In 1960, Koerppen married the violinist Barbara Koerppen, née Boehr. They lived in Burgdorf.
