Adam Cvijanovic (born 28 October 1960) is a painter based in New York City who was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He paints in large-scale format often using Tyvek sheeting as a substrate, which allows his work to be easily installed at multiple locations.  His work is concerned with exposing the historical and enduring hubris of American culture, painting forms that depict the search for and physical manifestation of American power and success on a monumental scale.  He is represented by Postmasters Gallery in New York.
