== Architectural style ==

Vivas' architectural style tends to consist of the International Style and modernism, though he varied the two styles via naturalist and humanist influences. His architecture style also utilizes ecology. The best example of his work is the Venezuelan Pavilion in Hannover Expo in 2000; the pavilion is characterized by the shape of the orchid flower, which is fifty-nine feet tall and protrudes from the building with its thirty-foot petals opening and closing depending on the weather.
