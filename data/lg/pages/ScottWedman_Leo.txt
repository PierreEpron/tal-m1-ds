He represented the Kansas City Kings twice in the NBA All-Star Game.  During his time in Kansas City, Wedman gained the nickname "The Incredible Hulk" because of his extensive sessions in the weight room.  On March 4, 1979, Wedman was involved in a 1-car accident in which his Porsche overturned on a rainy highway in Kansas City.  At the time, doctors credited his conditioning with keeping him out of action for only a few games.

At the 1981 NBA draft, seeing that the Kings could not afford to keep both Wedman and fellow All-Star Otis Birdsong, Kansas City traded Birdsong and let Wedman sign with Cleveland.
A small forward, Wedman averaged 34.7 minutes, 16.5 points, 6.0 rebounds and 2.3 assists and 1.2 steals in 547 games for the Kings over seven seasons, shooting 80% from the line, 49.0% from the field and 32.3% from three (after the 3-point line was introduced in 1979).

He knew that players like Larry and Kevin were going to get their minutes, and he accepted his role without hesitation," said Celtics Coach KC Jones about Wedman's tenure in Boston. "He had the perfect attitude. As a coach, you couldn’t ask for anything more.  He was an important piece of two championship teams."Wedman averaged 14.9 minutes in his five seasons in Boston, shooting 47.2% from the floor and 35.5% on three-pointers, averaging 6.2 points and 2.1 rebounds.
