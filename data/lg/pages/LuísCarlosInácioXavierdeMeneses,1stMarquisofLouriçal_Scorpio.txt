D. Luís Carlos Inácio Xavier de Meneses, 1st Marquis of Louriçal, 5th Count of Ericeira, (4 November 1689 - 1742), was a Portuguese nobleman and statesman, that served as Viceroy of India twice.
His two tenures as Viceroy of Portuguese India were notable for his continued military successes and for his economic rehabilitation policies. His first tenure, between 1717 and 1721, started when he was only 27. His second tenure, between 1740 and 1742 started when he was only 51, and arrived in Goa, with 6 ships and 2,300 soldiers. Power and expansive policies led him to be dubbed the "greatest of the governors of the Orient of the first half of the 18th century."

In 1740, the Count of Ericeira, now Marquis of Louriçal, was nominated Viceroy of India by King John V of Portugal, for the second time.The squadron sailed to Goa on 7 May 1740, in a squadron of 6 ships, those were: Nossa Senhora da Esperança (70), commanded by Luís de Abreu Prego; Nossa Senhora do Monte do Carmo (74), commanded by D. Francisco Xavier Mascarenhas; Nossa Senhora da Conceição (74), commanded by António Carlos Pereira de Sousa; Nossa Senhora da Nazaré (50), commanded by Bernardo António Rebelo da Fonseca; Nossa Senhora das Mercês (frigate), commanded by Luís de Pierrepont; Bom Jesus de Vila Nova (frigate), commanded by José Caetano de Matos.The squadron was carrying 4 battalions with 2,300 soldiers from Cascais, Lagos, Peniche and Porto, and 16 new type cannons that shot 16 rounds per minute, made by the Danish-born Portuguese officer Frederico Weinholtz.On 18 July, near the Cape of Good Hope, the squadron separated, so that the fastest ships could arrive in India with the monsoon of this year.Esperança (that was carrying the Viceroy) and Monte do Carmo, anchored in the Bay of St. Augustine, with damage and a lot of men with scurvy. They anchored there for 28 days, arriving later in Mozambique Island, Esperança arrived in Goa on 13 May 1741 and Monte do Carmo on 18 May. The rest of the ships also had a lot of problems in the voyage.Conceição anchored in the Bay of All Saints, because a lot of men died and need for repairs, on 29 October she sailed from it and arrived on Mozambique Island on 11 February, arriving in Goa on 18 May, in the same day as Monte do Carmo.Nazaré sunk in the entry of the Bay of All Saints, saving the money and the silver that were on board.Bom Jesus anchored in Rio de Janeiro, with a lot of soldiers dying, that were replaced. This ship arrived in Goa on 1 June 1741.Mercês also anchored in Rio de Janeiro, where did she continued her voyage to Goa, passing by outside of Mozambique Island, arriving in Goa on 23 February 1741.From the 2,300 soldiers on board, only 912 soldiers arrived in Goa. Luís de Abreu Prego also died in the voyage.In a letter to António Guedes Pereira, then the Secretary of State of the Navy and Overseas Domains, the Marquis of Louriçal wrote that the blame for the loss of Nazaré was of "all of the officers, some that insisted to enter the Bay of All Saints in the night, even with fog, heavy rain and rough sea, and others for not opposing with such a certainly disorder, as unfortunately proved.".
