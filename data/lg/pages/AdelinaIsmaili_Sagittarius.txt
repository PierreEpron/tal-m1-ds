Adelina Ismaili (Albanian pronunciation: [adɛˈlina iˈsmai̯li]; born 14 December 1979) is a Kosovo-Albanian singer, actress, and former beauty pageant winner.


== Career ==
Ismaili started singing at a very young age, becoming one of Kosovo's most influential singers during the 90s. She started competing in various children's festivals in the Albanian territories, such as the Akordet e Kosovës, Festivali i këngës për fëmijë në RTSH and many others. During her teenage years, Adelina released many songs that spoke about children's rights and the lives of teenagers. She was one of the first singers in Kosovo who managed to touch topics that others of her age couldn't.After taking a short break, Adelina released other songs that created a whole new era in the Albanian music industry, bringing new styles of dressing and singing on stage, which had never been seen before. She is also highly recognised as a sex symbol for her provocative videos and performances on Albanian local television stations. Her songs that brought a lot of attention were: "Amaneti", "Qe 1 vjet e 7 ditë", and "Shota". She sang a lot of songs dedicated to the victims of the Kosovo War, for instance "Lavdi ushtarit tim" (Honor to My Soldier). Adelina was crowned Miss Kosovo in 1997.
