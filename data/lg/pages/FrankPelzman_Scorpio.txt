A long time member of the township council, Pelzman became mayor in 2002, after Jim McGreevey resigned to become Governor of New Jersey.  Pelzman was elected by the Township Council in January 2002 to serve until the November 2002 special election for mayor, which he won.  He was elected to a full four-year term as mayor in 2003.  He died of cancer in June 2006, a month after being diagnosed. Since he was a supporter of outdoor youth recreation, a park was dedicated in his name on October 19, 2006.
