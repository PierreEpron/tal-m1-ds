Ryōichi Hattori (服部 良一, Hattori Ryōichi, October 1, 1907 Osaka – January 30, 1993) was a Japanese pop and jazz composer. Katsuhisa Hattori is his son. He had a great influence on Japanese pop and was awarded the People's Honor Award. Japanese jazz was downtrodden during World War II, but he created a jazz boom after the war. He composed many songs for various artists such as Noriko Awaya, Shizuko Kasagi, Ichimaru and Ichirō Fujiyama. He also composed Li Xianglan's song "Suzhou Nocturne" (蘇州夜曲, Soshū yakyoku), which has remained controversial in China despite not being a militaristic song.
