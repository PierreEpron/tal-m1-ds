== Biography ==
Florent Mothe was born on May 13, 1981 in Argenteuil, Val-d'Oise. He began studying music at the age of 7, at the Montigny-lès-Cormeilles school. He soon learned to play the flute, piano, bass, synthesizer and guitar, but singing was always his primary interest.
He formed his first band, Lost Smile, in 1996, and toured for around six years between France and Germany. At the same time, he played the savant in the musical l'Alphoméga, on the recording and in one performance of the show. Following that, he sang at the Hard Rock Café with his second group, Ouija. He then went to Toronto, where he began a solo career. He performed short concerts in Canadian bars, as well as at the Mod Club in New York.
His performances and recordings on his Myspace page brought him to the attention of Dove Attia and Albert Cohen, producers of Mozart, l'opéra rock, who invited him to attend casting for the musical. He was chosen for the role of Antonio Salieri. In 2010, he was awarded the title of "Francophone Discovery of the year" at the NRJ Music Awards.
His first solo album, Rock in Chair, was released in April 2013. The first single is called Je ne sais pas.
Florent played King Arthur in Dove Attia's new musical La Légende du roi Arthur with David Carreira, Zaho, Camille Lou and Fabien Incardona in 2015.
