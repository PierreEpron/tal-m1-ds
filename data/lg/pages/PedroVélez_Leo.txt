President Guerrero stepped down from the presidency and handed it over to José María Bocanegra in order to personally lead his troops against the rebels. On December, 1829 the Plan of Quintanar, a pronunciamiento in favor of the rebels was proclaimed within the capital and aided by Jose Ignacio Esteva, the governor of the federal district. Inteirm President Bocanegra and the commandant general Anaya made no moves to suppress the revolt so on the night of December 22, the rebels stormed the National Palace and captured it without resistance.The rebels then set up an interim executive triumvirate with Pedro Vélez as the president. The other two members were Lucas Alamán and Luis Quintanar. The executive only lasted two weeks and focused on consolidating the revolution. The partisans of Guerrero: Lorenzo de Zavala, Manuel Rejon, and Fernando del Valle were arrested but were released a few days later upon promising to recognize the new government. On January 1, 1833, power passed over to Anastasio Bustamante.
