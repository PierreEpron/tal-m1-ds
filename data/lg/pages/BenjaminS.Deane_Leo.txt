Benjamin S. Deane (1790–1867) was an American master builder and architect in practice in Bangor, Maine from circa 1832 to 1867.


== Life and career ==
Benjamin Small Deane was born August 7, 1790 in Thomaston, Maine to Jonas Deane and Ruth (Small) Deane. A housewright by training, he built churches in Thomaston and Belfast before moving to Bangor circa 1832. He quickly became locally successful, and in 1835 was chosen builder of St. John's Episcopal Church, an important early work of architect Richard Upjohn. He continued thereafter as a builder, but like many master builders was also responsible for the design of buildings he built. It is not known when Deane began to use the title "architect," but was at least by the early 1850s. During the remainder of his life he was the only settled practicing architect in Maine outside of Portland.As a designer, Deane paid close attention to national trends. Though in his early career he kept to the Greek Revival style, in his later career he designed some of the earliest Italianate and Second Empire buildings in Maine. During the early 1850s he was assisted in his office by Edwin Lee Brown, later an architect in Boston and New York City. In 1859 Deane was supervising architect for Brown in the construction of the Wheelwright Block, which is frequently and incorrectly attributed to Deane alone.


== Personal life ==
In 1814 Deane was married to Elizabeth Fales of Thomaston. He died December 2, 1867.Deane was elected several times to both houses of the Bangor city council. He was a member of the common council for the years 1838–39, 1848–49 and 1849–50 and of the board of alderman for the years 1842–43, 1844–45, 1845–46.


== Legacy ==
Deane's First Baptist Church at Sedgwick, built in 1837, has been identified by former National Park Service architectural historian Denys Peter Myers as "one of the finest and most suavely designed wooden Greek Revival churches in New England." In this and other works Deane borrowed from pattern books, including those of Asher Benjamin.At least seven of his works are listed on the United States National Register of Historic Places, and others contribute to listed historic districts.
