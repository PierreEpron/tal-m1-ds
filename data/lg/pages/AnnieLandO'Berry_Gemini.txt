While living with her brother in Kinston, O’Berry was very active in the North Carolina Federation of Women's Clubs. She became the first chair of the Anti-Tuberculosis Committee of Wayne County where she was the president for two years. O’Berry gave her time and effort to what was then called the Charity Organization of Goldsboro. She later went to Columbia University in order to learn more about this type of work. O’Berry also helped her father-in-law, Captain Nathan O’Berry of Goldsboro, raise over $5,000.00 to help white collar people during the depression. As a result, Governor Angus McLean appointed her to the Commission to Study County Government and the North Carolina Historical Commission. O’Berry also worked in the Goldsboro Club in Women's Club Work. She was elected vice-president of the State Federation in 1923 and, in 1927, was elected president.
O’Berry's literacy committee sponsored an Educational Pilgrimage to Washington. It was recognized as one of the most outstanding projects of adult education in the United States. She was later named the vice-chair of the state executive committee of the Democratic Party in 1930. Three years later, in 1933, O’Berry became one of the few women to administer a state emergency relief agency as she became the administrator of the Civil Works Commission. The Civil Works Commission later became the North Carolina Emergency Relief Administration (NCERA). O’Berry continued to remain in-charge of an offshoot of NCERA, called the Rural Rehabilitation Corporation, until her death. This offshoot provided loans to farmers. Through her diplomacy, O’Berry provided both direct and indirect relief to many citizens.

O’Berry worked to help clubwomen overcome indifference to civic responsibility. She inspired them to be civic-minded and to work for the advancement of adult education. She was viewed as ‘the little soldier,’ ‘relief lady,’ and a symbol of ‘food for the hungry, homes for the weary and a new chance for the discouraged.’ Although she had no children of her own, O’Berry raised her grand-nephew and grand-niece as her own.
