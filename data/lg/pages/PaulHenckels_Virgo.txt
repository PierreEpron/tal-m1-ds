Paul Henckels (9 September 1885 – 27 May 1967) was a German film and stage actor. He appeared in more than 230 films between 1921 and 1965. Paul Henckels had started his acting career on the stage in the 1900s.
He was well known for his eccentric, colourful roles and his trademark Rhineland accent. Among his most popular roles were the school teacher Professor Bömmel in Die Feuerzangenbowle (1944) and the veterinarian Dr. Pudlich in the "Immenhof film series" during the 1950s. He was also notable as a stage actor and appeared at the Schauspielhaus Berlin for many years. His most popular stage role was Wibbel the Tailor, which he played more than 1000 times.
Henckel's father was Jewish, and he was thus a "half-Jew" by the rules of the Nazis. As a rare exception, Henckels was nonetheless allowed to work during the Third Reich. He apparently owed this exception to the intervention of his friend Gustaf Gründgens and to his continuing popularity as a character actor. His wife, Thea Grodtczinsky, was Jewish. She could not work during the Third Reich, but her connections and Henckel's apparently prevented her from being deported to concentration camps.
