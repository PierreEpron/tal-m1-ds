== NFL career ==
Humphrey was one of five players selected in the 1989 NFL Supplemental Draft, selected in the first round by the Denver Broncos. During his rookie season, he rushed for 1,151 yards and seven touchdowns for the Broncos; he also threw a 17-yard touchdown pass and hauled in a touchdown reception. The Broncos qualified for Super Bowl XXIV, but were defeated 55-10 by the San Francisco 49ers.  Humphrey, although finishing the game as the Broncos leader in both rushing (61 yards) and receiving (31 yards), had a key turnover in the first quarter when he fumbled near midfield. Following this fumble, the 49ers would score 34 unanswered points to put the game away.  He followed his rookie season with a Pro Bowl selection in 1990, rushing for 1,202 yards and seven touchdowns in 1990. Humphrey was the first Denver Bronco to rush for 1,000 yards in back-to-back seasons.
In 1991, Humphrey held out of training camp in hopes of obtaining a new contract.  The Broncos, by team policy, refused to renegotiate his pay and the holdout continued late into the season. Unable to secure a new contract, Humphrey finally ended his holdout in week 14.  However, by that time, newly signed Gaston Green had emerged as the team's starting running back and was on his way to completing his own 1,000-yard season.  Furthermore, Humphrey had fallen out of favor with the team's coaching and front office as a result of the holdout.  When Humphrey returned in week 14, he was out of shape and given only a reserve role in the Broncos' offense.  He remained on the bench as Denver made a run to the AFC Championship Game, losing to the Buffalo Bills 10-7.
The following offseason, Humphrey was traded to the Miami Dolphins in exchange for running back Sammie Smith.  He played for the Dolphins in 1992 scoring only one rushing touchdown and running for 471 yards; he also finished with 507 receiving yards and a touchdown reception. With his new team, Humphrey returned to the AFC Championship Game for the second consecutive season, losing again to the Buffalo Bills. After being out of football for two seasons, Humphrey attempted a comeback in 1995 with the Bills, but failed to make the team.


== Arena football coaching career ==
In August 1999, the Birmingham Steeldogs formed as part of a new indoor football league called AF2, a developmental league for the Arena Football League. Humphrey, with no coaching experience at that level, was named head coach. Over the course of six seasons, Humphrey guided the Steeldogs to a 51-50 record. After a disappointing 2-14 season, Humphrey was dismissed in 2005. The Steeldogs would rename themselves as the Alabama Steeldogs one year later, before ceasing operations following the 2007 season. The league would fold in 2009. Humphrey, at the time of his dismissal, was the second-winningest coach in the league.
