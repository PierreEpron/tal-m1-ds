=== A-League Years (1997–2001) ===
Busch was undrafted out of college by Major League Soccer. Instead, he spent a number of years in the United Soccer Leagues. He was drafted in 1997 by Nashville Metros with the 2nd overall pick in the A-League draft, but opted to split his first year with Worcester Wildfire and Carolina Dynamo. Busch then moved on to Hampton Roads Mariners, where he spent 3 seasons. He was named the team MVP in his second season. His breakout season came in 2001 with the Hershey Wildcats.  He won 14 games and posted 13 shutouts while leading the team to the A-League National Championship match.  Busch was named the A-League Goalkeeper of the Year and was selected the Division II circuit's first-team All-League keeper.


=== Columbus Crew (2002–2006) ===
Major League Soccer took note of his USL play and it resulted in Busch being drafted by Columbus Crew with the 23rd overall pick of the 2002 MLS SuperDraft.  Busch did not become a starter for the Crew immediately, sharing the duties in his first MLS season with incumbent Tom Presthus.  He became a starter by 2003, but did not do very well as Columbus floundered in the standings.  In contrast, both the Crew and Busch had terrific 2004 regular seasons, as the team, led by Busch's goaltending, embarked on a league-record 18-game undefeated streak.  Busch was a finalist for the 2004 MLS Goalkeeper of the Year Award for his performance, and his impact on the team's season was cited as the third-highest impact of any MLS player on any MLS team in the history of the league by MLSnet writer Jeff Bradley.  In 2005, he was sidelined by a knee injury for most of the season, leading the Crew to acquire Jonny Walker.  The Crew's goalkeeping injury woes intensified in 2006, as Busch was one of several injured keepers on the team roster, managing only eight games. He was waived prior to the 2007 season.


=== Chicago Fire (2007–2009) ===
Busch found himself the only player picked in the 2007 MLS Waiver Draft, selected by Toronto FC. On March 21 of the same year, he was waived by Toronto as the team found itself over the limit for senior international roster spots. He was subsequently traded to Chicago Fire in exchange for a fourth-round pick in the 2009 MLS Supplemental Draft. Busch was to serve primarily as a backup keeper in 2007 and only made it into three matches all season.
However, with the departure of starter Matt Pickens to Queens Park Rangers of England's second-tier Football League Championship, Busch ultimately inherited the starter's role with the Fire to start the 2008 season. He was named Fire MVP for the 2008 season after being the only Fire player to start and play 90 minutes in every MLS match during the regular season (2700 minutes). Busch posted the best saves percentage in the league (78.2) after making 122 saves on 156 shots faced.  Busch tied for most shutouts in the league (10), while also tying a Fire single season shutout record shared with Matt Pickens for his 10 shutouts in 2007. For his efforts, Busch was named the MLS Goalkeeper of the Year. In March 2010, Busch was waived by the Chicago Fire.


=== San Jose Earthquakes (2010–2014) ===

Shortly after being waived, Busch was signed by San Jose Earthquakes. In 2014, Busch recorded a league best and franchise record 138 saves in a season, besting Joe Cannon's mark set in 2000.


=== Chicago Fire (2015) ===
Busch returned to Chicago for his second stint with the club in January 2015. At the end of the season his contract option was declined.


=== Indy Eleven (2016–2017) ===
In January 2016, Busch signed as a free agent with the NASL club Indy Eleven. He will also serve as the club’s Director of Goalkeeping, with duties to include first team coaching and scouting, serving as a guest coach with the Indy Eleven NPSL squad and assisting with the Indy Eleven Summer Soccer Clinic series.


=== Retirement ===
In May 2018, Busch made one last transfer move back to his first MLS club, Columbus Crew SC. He and the club had agreed a one-day contract so he could officially retire as a player of Crew SC, the club which he called home in his retirement letter.
