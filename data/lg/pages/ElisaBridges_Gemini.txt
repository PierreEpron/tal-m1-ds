Elisa Rebeca Bridges (May 24, 1973 â€“ February 7, 2002) was an American actress and model. She was Playboy magazine's Playmate of the Month for December 1994, and Playboy's Video Playmate of the Month for September 1996. She appeared in several video productions from Playboy Home Video from 1996 to 2000. After appearing in Playboy, she modeled frequently on assignments in Los Angeles, Miami, and Hawaii. She also appeared as a model for Perfect 10. She was born in Miami and raised in Dallas.
On February 7, 2002, Bridges died in a guest bedroom of the Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles mansion of Edward Nahem, a longtime acquaintance of Hugh Hefner. Nahem last saw Bridges the previous evening and knew she had a noon appointment the following day, then became concerned after arriving home that evening and finding her car still in the driveway. He found her unresponsive in her bed and attempted CPR as instructed by 911 operators; paramedics arrived and pronounced her dead on the scene. The room contained no illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia; a bottle of Xanax was found in her purse and a plastic cup with a white, powdery substance was found in the bathroom wastebasket. Although Playboy stated that she died of natural causes, the official coroner's report listed her "manner of death is accident ... Acute intoxication by the combined effects of heroin, methamphetamine, meperidine and alprazolam".
