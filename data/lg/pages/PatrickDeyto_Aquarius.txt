=== Global Cebu ===
On 15 July 2014, he joined United Football League club Global. Deyto was often benched during his first year with Global despite according to himself that he played 60 percent of the club's games but was given the chance to perform in the last four games of the 2014 UFL season which led to him becoming the first choice keeper of Global. In the 2016 UFL season, Deyto helped the club win the league title and played 90 percent of the club's matches. He also helped Global clinch the 2016 UFL Cup where he was named Best Goalkeeper. He remained with his club, which renamed itself as Global Cebu FC, when it joined the inaugural Philippines Football League (PFL) in 2017.

=== Stallion Laguna ===
Deyto joined Stallion Laguna in January 2019. However, Deyto only played for Stallions for the first half of the 2019 PFL season. The uncertainty of the PFL, with clubs either folding or leaving the league in the past seasons, prompted Deyto to accept an offer to play in Thailand.
