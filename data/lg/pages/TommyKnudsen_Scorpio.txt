Tommy Knudsen (born 9 November 1961 in Roager, Denmark) is a former Motorcycle speedway rider who won eight Speedway World Team Cups, and two World Pairs. He is not to be confused with Tom P Knudsen (born 1968), another rider from the period.


== Career ==
Knudsen first became known when he won the Danish Under-16 Championship in 1975 and 1976 before becoming the Danish Under-21 Champion in 1978.
He became Speedway World Pairs Champion in 1985 with individual World Champion Erik Gundersen and again in 1991 with Hans Nielsen and Jan O. Pedersen. Tommy was also European (World) Under-21 Champion in 1980.
In his first World Final appearance, Knudsen finished a career best 3rd in 1981 at Wembley Stadium in London after losing a ride-off for 2nd to countryman Ole Olsen. Knudsen had earlier defeated Olsen to win the opening heat of the World Final.
After winning the European U/21 title in 1980 and finishing 3rd in the World Final in 1981, a number of fans and members of the speedway press believed that Knudsen would become Denmark's next World Champion. Unfortunately for Knudsen, Denmark's next champion was Erik Gundersen who won the title in 1984 and 1985. Hans Nielsen would go on to win 4 World Championships while Jan O. Pedersen would win in 1991. Although he rode in a further five World Finals (1985, 1986, 1991, 1992 and 1994), Knudsen would never again finish on the podium in a World Final, his best placing being 4th in 1992.
Knudsen was also a member of the Danish team that won the Speedway World Team Cup in 1981, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1991, 1995 and 1997. At the 1985 Final held in Los Angeles, Knudsen was undefeated on the night, famously holding out US team captain Bobby Schwartz in the penultimate heat to ensure Denmark could not be beaten.
He rode in the UK for the Coventry Bees from 1979 to 1988 and then from 1990 to 1992.Knudsen also raced in Australia during the 1980s, winning the "Mr Melbourne" title at the Melbourne Showgrounds in January 1987, and a week later finished third behind fellow Dane Hans Nielsen and American Rick Miller in the West End Speedway International at the Wayville Showground in Adelaide. He announced his retirement at the end of August 1990 after a crash in Australia but returned to racing the following year.
