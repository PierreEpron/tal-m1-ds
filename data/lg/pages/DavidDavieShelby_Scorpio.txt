Born in Madison County, Alabama, Shelby was the son of Dr. David Shelby, and grandson of one-time Republic of Texas Supreme Court justice Anthony B. Shelby. He attended Cumberland University and read law to enter the bar in 1870. He was a soldier in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. Owing to his youth he was not regularly enlisted in the Confederate Army, but served four months with the 4th Alabama Cavalry Regiment, in a Georgia campaign. He entered private practice in Huntsville, Alabama from 1870 to 1899, serving as city attorney of Huntsville beginning in 1874. Shelby served as a member of Alabama Senate from 1882 to 1884.
