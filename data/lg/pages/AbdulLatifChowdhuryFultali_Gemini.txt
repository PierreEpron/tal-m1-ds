Abdul Latif Chowdhury was born on 25 May 1913, to a noble Bengali Muslim Sufi family in the village of Fultali in Badedeorail pargana, Sylhet district, Bengal Presidency (now in Zakiganj, Bangladesh). His paternal lineage joins to Shah Kamal, one of the later companions of Shah Jalal, via Ala Bakhsh, a sage who contributed to Ahmad Sirhindi's opposition against the Din-i Ilahi and other problematic opinions of Mughal emperor Akbar.

He was then taught by his distant cousin, Fatir Ali, at the Fultali Alia Madrasa, where he also studied the Qur'an with tajweed under Qari Syed Ali. In 1336 AH (1918 CE), Fultali became a student at the Rangauti Madrasa in Hailakandi at the request of its principal, Abdur Rashid, who was a student of Fultali's father. After successfully completing higher secondary examinations at Rangauti, Fultali enrolled into the Badarpur Senior Madrasa in Badarpur in 1338 AH (1920 CE) where he studied various Islamic sciences under his murshid Abu Yusuf Muhammad Yaqub Badarpuri. For higher education, Fultali then studied at the Rampur Alia Madrasah in Rampur State at the instruction of Badarpuri. He then enrolled into Matlaul Uloom Madrasah to specialise in Hadith studies under Khalillullah Rampuri and Wajihuddin Rampuri (student of Anwar Shah Kashmiri). He studied there for a few years and obtained first class, first position in the final Hadith exam in 1355 AH (1936 CE).

Now there are more than two thousand branches of the trust throughout the world engaged in educating people in the field of Tajweed.Abdun Nur Ali (1880-1963) of Gorkapon in Badarpur was a Mawlana who requested Abdul Latif Chowdhury Fultali to visit the mosque conjoined to Adam Khaki's shrine. In 1946, Fultali announced that he would be travelling to Badarpur to give a lesson on qira'at at Adam Khaki's mosque. Abd an-Nur Gorkaponi and his students purchased a horse for the scholar to ride on so the journey could be easier. From 1946 to 1950, Fultali was a teacher at the Badarpur Senior Madrasa. He began teaching Qur'an with tajweed from his own home in 1950. As a result of riots in the 1950s, Fultali briefly migrated to Pakistan.

He finally returned to Fultali Alia Madrasa, where he taught Hadith until his death.On 11 May 1967, a conference was held at the Shah Jalal Dargah. A memorandum strictly calling for the prohibition of shirki practices was signed by the leading Islamic scholars from Sylhet including Abdul Latif Chowdhury Fultali, Hormuz Ullah Shayda, Mushahid Ahmad Bayampuri, Ibrahim Chatuli and Nur Uddin Gohorpuri.Fultali was the best known and most influential spiritual leader among the British Bangladeshi community.
