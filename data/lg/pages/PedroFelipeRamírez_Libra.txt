=== Personal life ===
He is openly gay, assuming his homosexuality while in exile in Venezuela. In 1984, after returning to Chile, the National Information Center (CNI) threatened to publish evidence that would reveal his homosexuality, strongly rejected by society at the time. Although Ramírez and the rest of the Christian Left Party were not certain that the intelligence agencies of the dictatorship had this evidence, they preferred to avoid publicizing the situation. Thus, Ramírez left the general secretariat, being replaced by Luis Maira, and left the most relevant political positions.
