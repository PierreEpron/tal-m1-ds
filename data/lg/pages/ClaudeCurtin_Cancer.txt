Claude Frederick Curtin (4 July 1920 â€“ 13 December 1994) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Fitzroy in the VFL.
A full-forward, Curtin was the nephew of former Australian Prime Minister John Curtin. He kicked over fifty goals in a season on four separate occasions, from 1940 to 1942 and in 1946. In each of those seasons he topped Fitzroy's goalkicking. He would have been a member of the club's 1944 premiership side had he not be away on war service.
His grandson is former Hawthorn player and Carlton coach John Barker
