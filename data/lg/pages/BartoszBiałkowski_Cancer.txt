"I spoke with Pilks after the game and he said that it was the best game I’ve had for Notts County so I’m really pleased.

=== Ipswich Town ===

On 15 July 2014, Białkowski signed a two-year deal with Ipswich Town. He marked his Town league debut with a clean sheet in a 2–0 win at Blackpool on 1 November 2014.
