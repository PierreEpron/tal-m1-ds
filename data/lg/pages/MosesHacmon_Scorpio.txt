Faces of Water was Hacmon's first project that was released in 2013. It is the debut of his technique that captures water's invisible forms. Kyle VanHemert of Wired says "Hacmon worked out a technique involving a special type of film with a layer of liquid that records the movement of the water itself. The film leaves Hacmon with a full-size negative, which he then develops into pictures like the ones here–an analog process from start to finish."
