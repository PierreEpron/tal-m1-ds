=== Publications ===
Gubler wrote and illustrated his first book, Rumple Buttercup: A Story of Bananas, Belonging and Being Yourself, which was released on April 2, 2019. It is published as a children's book, but Gubler says it is for all ages, "for anyone who's ever felt like they didn't quite fit in, just to make them know that they're not alone ... My hope in writing the book was to find a way to give the world a 136-page hug." He hand-wrote or hand-drew everything in the book – "every single word, every single illustration, including the bar code and the lengthy copyright page." Within weeks of its release, the book was ranked #1 in its category on the New York Times Best Seller list.The story concerns a sensitive monster named Rumple Buttercup, who is so self-conscious about his appearance – green skin, five crooked teeth, and three strands of hair – that he fears he will be rejected by people, so he spends his life hiding in a sewer. He emerges only at night, wearing a banana peel on his head as a disguise. Eventually he discovers that people actually do accept him despite his differences. In promotional appearances, Gubler sometimes wears a 7-foot-tall Rumple costume or a banana peel on his head. He initially planned to self-publish the work, but decided that Random House would be a good fit for him at his first meeting: "The Random House publishers came to the meeting with banana peels on their heads, and I was immediately enchanted."
