Ross Baillie (26 September 1977 – 18 June 1999) was a Scottish track and field athlete, older brother of Commonwealth Silver medal winner Chris Baillie.  Both his parents were also track and field athletes, father Hugh representing Great Britain at 400m, and mother Sheila being a former Scottish champion at 80m hurdles (superseded by the 100m hurdles since 1968). Deemed by Colin Jackson to be his natural successor in the 110m hurdles event for Great Britain, he died at the age of 21.  Fittingly, since his death, the records set by Ross have been broken by his brother.
