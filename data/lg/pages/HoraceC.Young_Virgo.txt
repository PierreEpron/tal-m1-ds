He was the son of Henry Young (1775–1852) and Philany (Kellogg) Young (1783-1865). He was born in that part of the Town of Smithfield which was separated in 1823 as the Town of Fenner, in Madison County, New York. He became a builder and architect. On January 19, 1831, he married Laura P. Walker (1808–1890), and they had six children, among them Congressman H. Olin Young (1850–1917).
In May 1832, the couple removed to New Albion, in Cattaraugus County. He was elected a Justice of the Peace in 1834; and was Supervisor of New Albion in 1843, and from 1845 to 1848. He drew the plans for the first Minnesota State Capitol which burned down in 1881.
He was a member of the New York State Assembly (Cattaraugus Co., 2nd D.) in 1849 and 1850; and of the New York State Senate (32nd D.) in 1862 and 1863.
