== Managerial career ==


=== Ahed ===
In 2007 Marmar was appointed assistant manager of Ahed, which was coached by German manager Robert Jaspert. Describing his time as Jaspert's assistant, Marmar stated that he "felt like a partner", which was "what made [him] want to become a coach". Following his retirement as a player in 2010, Marmar went to Germany to get coaching courses. Upon his return to Lebanon, he was appointed technical director of Ahed's academy and youth sector. He won the under-15 league in 2012, the under-17 league in 2013 and 2014, and the under-17 league in 2015 and 2016.In 2014 and 2015, Marmar was Ahed's caretaker manager; he became Ahed's first team manager in 2016 following the departure of Robert Jaspert. In his first season as coach, Marmar won the 2016–17 Lebanese Premier League. Marmar was nominated 2016–17 Lebanese Premier League Coach of the Season. After winning the league, Marmar went back to coaching Ahed's youth side, citing difficulties with the players as the main reason.Three matchdays into the 2017–18 season, Marmar was re-appointed as head coach of Ahed. Marmar stated: "At that moment, there was a shift of mentality in the club. The players were starting to get accountable for their actions. The issues I faced when I was there started to vanish, so I took back the job." That season, Marmar helped Ahed win the domestic double, lifting both the league and FA Cup titles. He was awarded Lebanese Coach of the Season for the second consecutive time.In 2018–19, Marmar helped Ahed win a second successive domestic double, lifting the league, FA Cup, and Super Cup.

Ahed only conceded three goals in 11 games, going unbeaten throughout the whole tournament. For the third consecutive time, Marmar was named Lebanese Coach of the Season.
