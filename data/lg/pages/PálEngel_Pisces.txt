Pál Engel (27 February 1938 – 21 August 2001) was a Hungarian medievalist historian and archivist, and member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. He served as General Director of the Library of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences between 1996 and 1997. Despite Engel being an autodidact historian (who had no degree in history), he became a preeminent medievalist, and member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.
