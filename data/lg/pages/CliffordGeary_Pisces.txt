Clifford N. Geary (February 26, 1916 â€“ May 31, 2008) was an American illustrator of science fiction, especially Robert A. Heinlein's "juvenile series" published by Scribner's from 1948 to 1956, and of popular science.
Many of his Heinlein illustrations are done in a  reversed-ground white-on-black style.  Alexei Panshin's "Heinlein in Dimension" (a controversial work that Heinlein is said to have disavowed) acknowledges Geary's contribution to this important element of the Heinlein oeuvre, calling his work "quite unusual and quite striking."
Geary was raised in the Boston area and was educated at the Massachusetts School of Art.  In later life he lived in Brooklyn and the Adirondacks.  His book illustrations were sometimes credited to "Clifford Geary".
