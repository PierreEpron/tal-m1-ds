== Career ==
Heath was born in Chesterfield, grew up in Birchover, and played for Darley Dale as a boy. He joined Leeds United's youth system as an 11-year-old, and moved to Manchester United at 14. He earned his professional contract at the end of 2000. He joined Royal Antwerp of the Belgian First Division on loan in January 2003; he played 13 league games in the 2003–04 season, but saved his goalscoring for friendly matches. He then joined Football League Two side Cambridge United on a month's loan in late 2004, and made his English first-team debut on 7 December in a 2–1 defeat at home to Scunthorpe United. He spent the first half of the 2005–06 season on loan to Swindon Town, but scored only once, against Yeovil Town in his home league debut, and struggled to maintain a first-team place.He returned to Manchester United in January 2006 and was released, to join Chesterfield until the end of the season. He moved on to Macclesfield Town, linking up with former Manchester United colleague Tommy Lee, but was released by manager Paul Ince after just one season. In September 2007, after an extended trial with Chester City, he signed for Farsley Celtic of the Conference National. Heath struggled to hold down a first-team place due to the form of Damien Reeves. After a handful of appearances, including helping Farsley to reach the last 16 of the FA Trophy for the first time, he left the club.
Although no longer a professional, Heath still plays football in the Northern Counties East League Division 1 for Knaresborough Town. He is currently playing cricket for Heslington CC in York.
