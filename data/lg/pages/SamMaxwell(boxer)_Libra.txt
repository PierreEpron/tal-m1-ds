In the final minute of the contest Sediri began showboating, dancing around the ring with his hands down by his side. With less than 15 seconds to go and his opponent still neglecting his defence, Maxwell landed a solid right hand to leave Sediri sprawled out on the canvas. He was able to get back to his feet before the referee's count of ten but immediately stumbled on unsteady legs, prompting the referee to call a halt to the contest with seconds left in the round, awarding Maxwell a tenth-round technical knockout (TKO) and the WBO European title. After a second-round knockout (KO) win over Oscar Amador in a six-round non-title fight in July, Maxwell retained his title against Connor Parker with a seventh-round TKO in November.
