Franks was not selected in the 1975 NFL Draft.  Franks later recalled, "The computers said I was too small.  I just didn't believe the computers." He tried out with the Philadelphia Eagles and Oakland Raiders in 1975, but both teams cut him during training camp.  He tried out with the Eagles again in 1976 and made the team.  As a rookie, he appeared in 14 games for the Eagles as a special teams player.  During the 1977 season, Franks was given the opportunity to play at the center position.  Following an injury to the team's starting center Guy Morriss, Franks played one game as the Eagles' starting center.Franks was waived by the Eagles in August 1979.  He had played for the Eagles for three years from 1976 to 1978, appearing in a total of 44 games.  The Philadelphia Inquirer later summarized Franks' career as follows: "For the Eagles, Dennis Franks was a bit player who made himself important to the team by sheer force of personality. He was gung-ho, articulate and hard-working. Whatever coach Dick Vermeil wanted him to do, whether it was to fill in at an unusual position or work out year after year just to sit on the bench, Franks never lost his enthusiasm for the game or the team. His attitude may have been his most important team contribution."In September 1979, Franks signed to play for the Detroit Lions.  The Lions announced that they would use him as the center on punts and on special teams. Franks appeared in 13 games for the Lions during the 1979 NFL season.
