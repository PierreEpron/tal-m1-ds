Pospíšil began his musical career in 1969 as a co-founder of the group C&K Vocal, together with Jiří Cerha, Ladislav Kantor, Petra Janů, Helena Arnetová, Milena Červená, and Karel Klos. He recorded the album Generation with the group in 1975. In the 1980s, he launched a solo career and in 1982, released his debut album, Tenhle vítr jsem měl rád, which included compositions by Ota Petřina and lyrics by Kantor. His second album, Love Prayer, was recorded with the group 5P and released in 1983. His next two albums, ...a nestřílejte na milence (1986) and Jsem v tom (1987), were both credited to the band, which included multi-instrumentalist Michal Pavlík (Čechomor, George & Beatovens) and drummer David Koller (Jasná Páka, Blue Effect, Lucie). 5P also included guitarist Bohumil Zatloukal (Jasná Páka), who worked on Pospíšil's next record, Vzdálená tvář, in 1993. The two have since occasionally toured together as an acoustic duo.
Between 1988 and 1990, Pospíšil sang and played guitar in the rock band Blue Effect. His only recording with them was the 1989 single "Kampa" and its B-side, "Úhel pohledu", both of which he wrote.
