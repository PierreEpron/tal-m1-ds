== Playing career ==


=== Club ===
In 1975, O'Neill turned professional with the Hartford Bicentennials of the North American Soccer League.
The following fall, the Bicentennials sent him on loan to Glasgow Rangers F.C. of the Scottish League.  The Bicentennials failed to perceive that O'Neill's Roman Catholic faith and his family history of supporting Celtic could present a problem.  Despite this, O'Neill played every reserve game that season, except for the games against the Celtic reserves.  The Bicentennials became the Connecticut Bicentennials for the 1977 season.  The Bicentennials sent him to the Dallas Tornado during the season.
In 1978, he became the first player signed by the Memphis Rogues.  He later played for the Carolina Lightnin' of the American Soccer League.  In September 1981, he scored the game-winning goal as the Lightnin' took the ASL championship.  He continued with the Lightnin' in 1982, but lost part of the season when he returned to New Jersey to be with his dying father.  He played the 1980 indoor season with the Cleveland Force of the Major Indoor Soccer League.


=== International ===
O'Neill played for the 1976 U.S. Olympic Soccer team during its qualification campaign for the Olympic tournament.
