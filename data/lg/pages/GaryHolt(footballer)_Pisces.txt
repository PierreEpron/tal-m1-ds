In 2001, Norwich City paid £135,000 for Holt. He was voted Norwich City player of the year in 2001–02, when he also collected a number of fans' awards, including the Capital Canaries Player of the Season trophy. That season, Holt was a member of the Norwich team that reached the final of the Division One play-offs, losing on penalties to Birmingham City Holt played in Division One for his first three seasons with the club and helped them win promotion to the Premier League in 2004.

However, when Lambert left for Norwich City after only three game of the season, his contract was terminated without him making a single appearance for the club. On 6 October 2009, he signed for Isthmian League club Lowestoft Town.


=== International career ===
Despite his excellent form with Kilmarnock, international recognition with Scotland initially proved elusive for Holt, who briefly explored the option of playing for Canada in 1998 and for Northern Ireland in 1999; however, it emerged that he was not eligible for either. Holt made his Scotland debut on 2 September 2000 as an 89th-minute substitute against Latvia, in a match that Scotland won 1–0. He made ten appearances in total, with his final cap coming in a 1–1 draw against Moldova in October 2004. His only international goal came in a 4–1 win against Trinidad and Tobago in May 2004.

Holt was forced to take a temporary leave of absence from his role in August 2019 when he overexerted in a gym session and contracted rhabdomyolysis, causing his blood levels to rise to dangerous levels and his skeletal muscle to begin breaking down. The 2019–20 season provided further success for Holt and Livingston, as the Lions finished in fifth place. It was the club's second-highest ever league finish, and Holt won the Premiership manager of the month award for January 2020 and was nominated for the Scottish Football Writers' Association 'Manager of the Year Award'.After a bad start to the 2020–21 season, Holt resigned on 26 November.
