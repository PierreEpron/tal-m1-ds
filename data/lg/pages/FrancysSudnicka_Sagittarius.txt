Francys Mayela Sudnicka was born on 9 December 1979 in Valencia, Venezuela. Through her family's Polish ancestry, Sudnicka's parents were able to move to Poland with her when she was 2 years old. Sudnicka went to school in Poland and lived there until adolescence. Despite this, she never lost Venezuelan citizenship and was therefore able to represent Venezuela at beauty pageants.

Since Börger was highly successful representing Germany in international pageants, Sudnicka was a clear favourite to become at least a runner-up at Miss Universe, but she unplaced.
