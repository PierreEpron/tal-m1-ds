Andrew R. Liddle  (born 9 June 1965) is Professor of astrophysics at the Royal Observatory Edinburgh. Publications include books and over 260 papers. He is a theoretical cosmologist and is interested in understanding the properties of the Universe and how these relate to fundamental physical laws.


== Research ==
Liddle's research is on various aspects of cosmology and astrophysics, and in particular he is interested in the origin and evolution of structure in the Universe, with special focus on models and observational constraints on the inflationary cosmology, physics of the cosmic microwave background and the use of galaxy clusters as cosmological probes.
His areas of research include:

The origin and evolution of structure in the Universe
Models of and observational constraints on the inflationary cosmology
Physics of the cosmic microwave background
Dark energy in the Universe.He is involved in several international projects, including the Planck satellite, the Dark Energy Survey and the XMM Cluster Survey.
Before his position at the Royal Observatory Edinburgh he was a professor of cosmology at University of Sussex in Brighton.
