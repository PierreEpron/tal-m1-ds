Damon Jamal Collins (September 22, 1976 – October 26, 2014), nicknamed Mo Collins, was an American college and professional football player who was an offensive lineman in the National Football League (NFL) for six seasons during the 1990s and early 2000s.  Collins played college football for the University of Florida, and was a member of a national championship team.  The Oakland Raiders selected him in the first round of the 1998 NFL Draft, and he played his entire professional career for the Raiders.
