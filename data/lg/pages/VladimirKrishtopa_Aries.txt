Vladimir Vasilievich Krishtopa (Russian: Влади́мир Васи́льевич Кришто́па; born April 6, 1973) is a Ukrainian-born Russian murderer and rapist.


== Crimes ==


=== First murder ===
On June 17, 1995, Krishtopa, in a state of intoxication, attacked a woman on the staircase between the 6th and 7th floors of the No. 70 House on Orbitalnaya Street in Rostov-on-Don. The woman was raped by him, and then severely beaten. As a result of the beating, she died from a closed craniocerebral injury.

		
		


=== Second murder ===
A month later, on July 21, Krishtopa, again intoxicated, committed another murder, raping the woman before strangling her. He then stole her cassette player without the headphones.

		


=== Third murder attempt ===
Krishtopa did not commit any more crimes until August 3, when he was detained for attempting to kill a third woman. During the search, authorities found the audio player, which served as a crucial evidence.

		
		
		
		
On March 21, 1996, the Rostov Regional Court judge Mikhail Rebrov sentenced Vladimir Krishtopa to execution by firing squad. But soon, a moratorium was imposed on its application, and the criminal who was already on death row in Novocherkassk was resentenced to 25 years in prison. When Krishtopa was in cell number 117 of the Novocherkassk prison, his neighbor was notorious serial killer Vladimir Mukhankin. Subsequently, while giving an interview to the television program "Criminal Russia", Mukhankin told the following:

There, in the 117th [cell], stayed Krishtopa. He was here, on a death row, too, by the way, here, incidentally, here is the 45th cell, maybe he is still sitting there. Well, the complete scoundrel, but this, Amurkhan Khadrisovich, but this is a natural maniac. Because if a man weren't a maniac, he would not have gnawed his noses over there, nor would he sucked out there from the breasts over there, nor from the vagina, nor would he kill the little children, nor would not rape them over there, nor adults, nor especially grannies.
Krishtopa is also suspected of committing crimes in his native Ukraine before moving to Rostov.
