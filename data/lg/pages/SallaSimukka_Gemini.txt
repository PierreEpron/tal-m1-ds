== Biography ==
Simukka was born in Tampere and showed an interest in writing at a young age.

As a critic, she has written reviews for Helsingin Sanomat and Hämeen Sanomat. She has also worked as an editor for the literary journal LUKUfiilis and as a scriptwriter for the Finnish Broadcasting Company.


== Snow White Trilogy ==
Simukka came up with the idea for the Snow White Trilogy after visiting a bookstore in Germany and seeing a section for young adult thriller novels. She then realized that Finland did not have many novels that fit into the genre. Sony Pictures has shown an interest in adapting the series for film.The series has been pitched as “Lisbeth Salander for a young adult audience.”

In 2013, Simukka received two awards: the Topelius Prize for the best Finnish youth novel (for Jäljellä (Without a Trace) and Toisaalla (Elsewhere); and the Finland Prize for a promising breakthrough.
