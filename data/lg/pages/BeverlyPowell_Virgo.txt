Beverly Powell (born September 18, 1951), is an American politician from the state of Texas. A Democrat, she represented District 10 in the Texas Senate from 2019 to 2023.In 2018, Powell defeated incumbent Republican Senator Konni Burton by a margin of 3.4%. During redistricting in 2021, Texas Republicans redrew District 10 to be much more conservative and Powell opted to withdraw from her re-election campaign in 2022, citing the district as 'unwinnable' for a Democrat, and suggesting that the Democratic Party should fund other races instead. She was defeated by then-State Representative Phil King from Weatherford, Texas.
