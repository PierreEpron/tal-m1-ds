After arriving in 1989 at hometown's C.S. Marítimo, and going on to represent its every youth sides, Abreu never settled in the first team, constantly bouncing between that squad and the reserves. In 2004, he was released and joined Madeira neighbours A.D. Camacha in the third division, the same as Marítimo B.

On 6 February 2011, Abreu participated in his first game for his new team, playing the first 72 minutes in the 2–2 friendly draw with Ukraine's SC Tavriya Simferopol. His first official appearance came exactly one month later, against FC Amkar Perm for the campaign's Russian Cup (120 minutes played, 1–0 win); his league debut occurred six days later, in a 0–0 draw at FC Anzhi Makhachkala.
On 10 June 2011, Abreu scored his first goal for Krasnodar, in a 3–1 away success against FC Rostov. He left at the end of 2013–14, signing with fellow league club FC Torpedo Moscow shortly after but retiring from the game shortly after for family reasons.After two years of inactivity, 36-year-old Abreu returned to football with former club Camacha, still in the third level.
