=== Notable accolades ===
Was the first National No.1 Girl class title holder for the ABA.


=== Significant injuries ===
Broke her arm during practice at the ABA Summer Nationals in Elkhart, Indiana on August 14, 1983. She was laid up for approximately two weeks. She then had the cast formed around the handlebars of her bicycle in a grip fashion so she could pull up on them. Unlike other forms of bicycle racing, BMX racing involves pulling up on the handlebars to generate torque in aiding the legs in accelerating the bicycle out of the starting gate, lifting the front wheel over moguls and wheelieing out of turns. Appropriately accelerating out of turns is called "Pulling", a slang term created by Pro racer Ronnie Anderson.
