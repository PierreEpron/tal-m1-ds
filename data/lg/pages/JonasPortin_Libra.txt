In June 2012, days before the closing of the financial year of Parma on 30 June (Padova ended the financial year on 31 December), Parma signed Portin in co-ownership deal for a nominal account value of €2 million, in 3-year contract; co-currently Padova signed Niccolò Galli also in co-ownership deal for €2 million, thus a pure player exchange deal. The deal boosted both club financially as well as benefit in the field.Portin immediately returned to Padova in temporary deal.
