== Career ==
Farkas debuted in the Hungarian national team in 1993 and played on her first major tournament two years later, winning the silver medal on the World Championship. This was followed by two bronze medals at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta and the 1998 European Championship in the Netherlands. She crowned her international career with a silver medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney.At club level, Farkas achieved her best results with Ferencvárosi TC and Dunaferr SE, winning a combined six Hungarian championship and seven Hungarian cup titles. She was also member of the Dunaferr golden team that won both the EHF Cup and the EHF Championship League in 1998 and 1999, respectively.
Later she moved abroad to play for French side Metz Handball (2000–2002) and Slovenian top club RK Krim Ljubljana (2004–2005). Following her spell at Krim, Farkas gave up professional handball and joined Vasas SC as goalkeeping coach. However, after a serious knee ligament injury of Győri ETO KC's first choice goalkeeper Orsolya Herr just before the 2006 EHF Cup Winners' Cup finals, she was reactivated and signed by the Western Hungarian team for the decisive two matches. Győr eventually lost the duel with an aggregate score of 51–48 and Farkas resumed to her coaching duties.
During her time at Vasas, Farkas coached among others Žaneta Tóthová, who became the best sportswoman in Slovakia during this period, and Ágnes Triffa, who was given the Hungarian Junior Handball of the Year award in 2005 and made her full international debut in 2006. Farkas later had spells at Százhalombattai KE and Hort SE, and also worked for the Hungarian national team in younger age categories.Somewhat of a surprise, in January 2010, the then-40-year-old goalkeeper have decided to return to the field and signed a short-term deal with Luxembourgian club Roude Léiw Bascharage until the end of the season.Since 2011 she serves as the goalkeeping coach of Dunaújvárosi NKS and also works with youngsters on the club's newly founded handball academy.
