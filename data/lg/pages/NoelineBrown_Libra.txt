== Personal life ==
In 1976, Brown married one of the writer/producers of The Naked Vicar Show, Tony Sattler. The couple were close friends of Graham Kennedy; Noeline was present when Kennedy died in 2005. She and Sattler have lived in Bowral for many years, and Kennedy moved there to be closer to them. When Kennedy's health began to fail, Sattler and Brown reportedly contacted former Nine Network boss Kerry Packer to appeal for financial support to care for the ailing star (Kennedy having earned many millions of dollars for Packer and Nine in his heyday); Packer declined to assist Kennedy financially but, after the story became public, an anonymous benefactor (later revealed as former Nine Network chief Sam Chisholm) came forward and donated a substantial sum (reportedly AU$150,000) for Kennedy's ongoing support and care.
