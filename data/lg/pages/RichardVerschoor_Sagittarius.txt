He would win the race by several seconds, and just moments after taking the chequered flag, he ran out of fuel and stopped on track. Tragically, Verschoor was disqualified for having too little fuel in his car, thus promoting Logan Sargeant to victory.In the Paul Ricard round, Verschoor qualified 11th. He stalled during the start of the sprint race, and his car developed a technical issue. By the time he got going, he was five laps down.

In the feature race, he made an overcut pit stop on Dennis Hauger, who jumped him at the start. During a safety car restart, Verschoor punted Jack Doohan out of the race. Verschoor then scaled through for second place and a home podium. Despite not being penalised for the clash with Doohan, Verschoor apologised to him after the race.In Monza, Verschoor qualified fifth and finished in the same position in the sprint race, but was demoted to eighth place for gaining an advantage off-track. In the feature race, he ran on the alternate strategy but a safety car and red flag mid-race ruined his chances of a good result. Despite that, a pass late in the race on Marino Sato sealed tenth place, before being promoted to ninth following Ayumu Iwasa's disqualification. In Abu Dhabi, Verschoor qualified tenth. From reverse pole in the sprint race, he remained in the lead until lap 10, where he was passed by Lawson. Still, he collected a second place and added another podium. In the feature race, starting on the harder tyres would prove well, as he used his fresher tyres in the end to finish seventh. Verschoor ended the year 12th in the standings with 103 points, claiming one win and three more podiums.


==== 2023 ====
Verschoor participated in the post-season test with Van Amersfoort Racing.

What followed was a storming drive, making up numerous positions in the end with fresher tyres for fifth place. In Jeddah, Verschoor once again looked to be on the pace, however a mistake in qualifying meant he started 19th and 20th in the sprint and feature race respectively. In the feature race, Verschoor made the alternate strategy work and had amazing pace to finish 6th after starting 20th. In Melbourne Verschoor was unlucky in qualifying with an ill timed red flag, which meant he had to start 18th for both races. He managed to finish 10th in the sprint race, and drove to 7th in what was a chaotic feature race.In Baku, Verschoor qualified on reverse pole, but in the sprint race, spun into the wall at the first corner, ultimately ending his race.
