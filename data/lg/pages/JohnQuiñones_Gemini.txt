== Early life and education ==
Quiñones was born in San Antonio, Texas, on May 23, 1952. He is a fifth-generation San Antonian and a fifth-generation Mexican-American. Quiñones grew up in a Spanish-speaking household where he did not learn to speak English until he started school at age six. When he was 13 years old, his father was laid off from his job as a janitor at which the family joined a caravan of migrant farmworkers who traveled to Traverse City, Michigan, to harvest cherries. Later that summer, the Quiñones family followed the migrant route to pick tomatoes outside Toledo, Ohio.
While attending Brackenridge High School in San Antonio, Quiñones was selected to take part in the federal anti-poverty program, Upward Bound, which prepared inner-city high school students for college. As an undergraduate, Quiñones was also a member of the Sigma Beta-Zeta of Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. After graduating from St. Mary's with a Bachelor of Arts degree in speech communication, Quiñones earned a Master of Arts degree from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.

Quiñones worked as a radio news editor at KTRH in Houston, Texas from 1975 to 1978 and also worked as an anchor and reporter for KPRC-TV.  He later reported for WBBM-TV in Chicago. In 1982, Quiñones started as a general assignment correspondent with ABC News based in Miami. He was a co-anchor of the ABC News program, Primetime, and hosted What Would You Do?. He also reports for all ABC News programs such as 20/20, Good Morning America, ABC World News Tonight, and Nightline.
According to communications attorney Mark Lloyd, "Quiñones told the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) audience that he got his start because a San Antonio community organization threatened that if the stations didn't hire more Latinos, the group would go to the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) and challenge their licenses."
