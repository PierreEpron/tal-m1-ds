He appeared as a substitute fullback in Michigan's 50–0 victory over Albion and the team's 33–0 victory over Indiana. In its "Football Year-Book," The Michigan Daily-News said of Reid, "He has developed rapidly in the fullback position." The 1901 Michigan team was the first of Fielding H. Yost's "Point-a-Minute" teams. The team compiled a record of 11–0 and outscored its opponents 550 to 0.Reid was also a member of the varsity track team, competing in the hammer throw, during his first year at Michigan.  In May 1902, The Michigan Alumnus noted: "Reid, the sub-fullback on the Varsity, has been showing up remarkably well with the hammer, and the first of this week, threw it 126 feet, within less than four feet of the Intercollegiate record."  Reid received his law degree from Michigan in 1906.

Coming to take charge of the work in the spring of 1907 when the prospects were none too bright, he has developed and trained teams for the last three years that are a credit to him and to the school, and through them his hard work and excellent coaching is clearly shown. In his coaching and training he has not only given especial attention to each individual and to keeping the entire team in the best possible condition, but also has always insisted on team work so that his teams have all worked together like well lubricated machines. Too much cannot be said of Reid's ability as a coach and trainer of athletes.
