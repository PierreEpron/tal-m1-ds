Franz Reznicek (born 20 October 1903, date of death unknown) was an Austrian architect. After moving to Bludenz, Vorarlberg, where he initially headed an architectural firm with Alois Dönz, he was responsible for the design of numerous modernist buildings in the area during the 1930s.


== Biography and career ==
Franz Reznicek was born 20 October 1903 in Baden bei Wien. At the age of 12, he  moved to Innsbruck, where three years later he entered the four-year architecture program at the Bundeslehranstalt für Hochbau (National Institute of High-Rise Building). After interning with his instructor, L. Welzenbacher, Reznicek passed his graduation examination at the institute on 13 February 1923.
Following that he continued to work at the Welzenbacher firm as a full associate. In 1926 he transferred to the Innsbruck City building authority, and two years later became head of the Innsbruck Office of Architecture - North, in Bozen (now Bolzano, Italy).
After participating together with Alois Dönz in the Bregenz National Fire Insurance contest, in 1929 Reznicek relocated to Bludenz and opened an architectural firm with Alois Dönz. Finally in 1936 he succeeded in being accepted into the Zentralvereinigung der Architekten Österreichs (Central Association of Austrian Architects), and in 1949 he took a further examination in civil engineering for the Engineering Bureaux of Tyrol and Vorarlberg.
Following Dönz's retirement, Reznicek led the firm for a further five years before he too retired.
