In December 2003, Conley was introduced at his alma mater, Texas A&M University–Commerce, as the school's 17th head football coach after former coach, Eddie Brister announced his retirement.

Conley brought Valdosta State transfer quarterback Buster Faulkner to Commerce and he led the Lone Star Conference in passing. Conley fielded competitive teams during his tenure in Commerce, but in his five years worked for four athletic directors and had three teams that went 5–5, with the only championship of any kind coming in 2007 as the Lions won the North Division of the Lone Star Conference. After finishing 5–5 again in 2008, Conley was relieved of his duties and replaced by former Baylor University coach Guy Morriss.
