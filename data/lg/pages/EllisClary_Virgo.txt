Born in Valdosta, Georgia, he threw and batted right-handed, stood 5 ft 8 in (1.73 m) tall, and weighed 160 pounds (73 kg). He played in the Major Leagues during World War II, when the talent pool was depleted due to the military draft.

In 1943, he was traded during the season to the St. Louis Browns, where he became a reserve player. He was a member of St. Louis' only American League championship team, the 1944 Browns.
