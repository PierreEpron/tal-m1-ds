Forbes, calling himself "Bim," began his musical career in Vancouver in 1971 after winning a "Battle of the Bands" competition in Dawson Creek. Initially, he appeared as the opening act for such groups as Supertramp and Santana, but soon came to headline and sell out his own shows. His song "Can't Catch Me", from his first LP Kid Full of Dreams, was released as a single and hit the Top 10 in several major Canadian markets. His third LP "Thistles" was produced by Emitt Rhodes and featured Mac Cridlin, David Foster, Bob Glaub, Penny Nichols, Jeff Porcaro, Ron Tutt, Blue Williams and Jai Winding. Forbes has appeared as a headliner in most of Canada's major folk music festivals. In 1984, he toured in the US with fellow Canadian Ferron, with whom he performed a duet on the song "Proud Crowd/Pride Cried" for her album, Shadows on a Dime. In 1987, he began performing and recording as Roy Forbes.
He is also a member of the supergroup UHF, together with Shari Ulrich and Bill Henderson.Songs written by Forbes have been recorded by Sylvia Tyson, Garnet Rogers, Valdy, and Susan Jacks.
Since 2006, Forbes has hosted a weekly radio program called "Roy's Record Room" on the CKUA Radio Network in Alberta.
