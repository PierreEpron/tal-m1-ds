During the 1951 season with the Red Sox, his hot hitting earned him the nickname "Dutch the Clutch." As an active player, Vollmer threw and batted right-handed; he stood 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m) tall and weighed 185 pounds (84 kg).


== Early career ==
Vollmer was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. As a youth, he played for the Bridgetown Baseball League in Hamilton County, Ohio; Vollmer was a leader on the team that won the Hamilton County Grade School baseball championship in 1935, according to a publication called "News of the Reds" dated May 20, 1947.


== Professional career ==
Vollmer graduated from Western Hills High School in 1938 and signed as a free agent with the Cincinnati Reds the following year.
Vollmer did not appear for the Reds until May 31, 1942. After playing only 12 games, the 21-year-old joined the Army. He fought in World War II for three years. After his discharge, Vollmer returned to the Reds.Vollmer played in the major leagues over ten seasons between 1942 and 1954. His torrid stretch as a member of the 1951 Red Sox lasted from July 6–28. In 21 games played, Vollmer had 31 hits, including 13 home runs, four doubles, one triple, 40 runs batted in (RBI), and 25 runs scored. The streak saw him raise his batting average from .267 to .287 and included a three-homer game on July 26 against the Chicago White Sox at Fenway Park. For the season, however, Vollmer leveled off to a .251 average (matching his career mark), although he set personal bests in homers (22) and RBI (85). Boston sent him back to the Senators in 1953, and he finished his MLB career in September 1954 as a reserve outfielder and pinch hitter. In his 685 games in the majors, Vollmer had 508 total hits, including 77 doubles, and 69 homers. Vollmer recorded a .984 fielding percentage at all three outfield positions.
