Woodroof was born in Dallas, Texas, on February 3, 1950, to Garland Odell Woodroof (March 17, 1917, in Texas – December 3, 1983, in Dallas) and Willie Mae Hughes (November 25, 1917, in Oklahoma – November 19, 1996, in Dallas).His first marriage was to Mary Etta Pybus on June 28, 1969, in Dallas; they had a daughter, Yvette Lynn Woodroof (born February 1, 1970).

They divorced on March 4, 1986, after he was diagnosed with HIV.
It was recorded that Mr. Woodroof had a mercurial personality. One reporter writes that "Woodroof took guns to his doctor’s office, prompting Dr. Steven Pounders to 'fire him as a patient.'" Woodroof later sent the doctor roses, and the doctor took him back. Woodroof was said to have lost all his friends after they found out he was HIV-positive. The movie Dallas Buyers Club depicts Woodroof as holding homophobic views prior to contracting HIV. In interviews with Craig Borten, who would go on to write the screenplay for Dallas Buyers Club, Woodroof implied that his diagnosis, along with interactions with gay people living with AIDS through the buyers club, led to him changing his views on gay people. Other people who knew Woodroof said that he did not harbor anti-gay beliefs and claimed he was bisexual.

He acquired nutritional supplements and drugs not approved by the FDA for use in the United States, which he found helpful in ameliorating his symptoms. Woodroof established what he called the Dallas Buyers Club in 1988 as a front for distributing these drugs and other substances to AIDS patients.
