==== Controversy ====
During a performance of Hadestown on October 12, 2022, White twice reprimanded an audience member from the stage for recording the production. White was unaware that this audience member was not recording, and was in fact using a captioning device because she was disabled and needed it to understand the dialogue of the musical. The theatre and production issued official apologies, affirmed their future commitments to accessibility, and offered a complimentary ticket to the audience member to make up for the incident. White refused to apologize for the incident herself, while the audience member took to social media to urge users to stop harassing White, as the actress's social media profiles had been deluged with ageist and racist insults in response to the incident.
