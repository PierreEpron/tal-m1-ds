The residences of John Rolls included Bryanston Square, London; The Grange, Surrey; and The Hendre, Monmouthshire. The Bryanston Square home was at 3 Bryanston Square, Marylebone, Westminster, London. The Grange was in Bermondsey parish, Southwark, London. The Hendre estate was at Llangattock-Vibon-Avel, near Monmouth, Monmouthshire. It was initially the property of the Allen family, and was inherited by his mother, Sarah Coysh Rolls, the niece and heiress of Henry Allen (1691 – 1767). The Hendre was originally a hunting lodge. In 1830, the first of several expansions of The Hendre was undertaken. This was performed by architect George Vaughan Maddox, under the direction of John Rolls. The mansion's development primarily involved reconstruction of the south wing of the building.The second and third expansions of The Hendre were undertaken by his oldest son and successor John Etherington Welch Rolls, and grandson John Allan Rolls, respectively. Both men used the services of architect Thomas Henry Wyatt. Between 1837 and 1858, Wyatt built the great hall, made improvements to the grounds, and further increased the size of the south wing for John E W Rolls. In 1872, Wyatt took down the old stables
for John A Rolls, building larger stables. He not only added a coach house, but also rooms for billiards, smoking, and dining. A fourth enlargement of the mansion was performed in 1896, again for John A Rolls, then Lord Llangattock, with the addition of the library wing. The architect was Aston Webb (1849 – 1930), renowned for his work on Buckingham Palace, including its east facade. The Hendre at Llangattock-Vibon-Avel was grade II* listed on 4 November 1985. The Hendre estate remained in the Rolls family until 1987, and is now The Rolls of Monmouth Golf Club.
