== Design ==
From her post as Creative Director, Tiziana Dominguez designs the company’s collections, along with her father. She introduced ecological materials in all collections and backs sustainable fashion.

== Painting and sculpture ==
In May 2011, she presented her first painting exhibition, "Ants, horses & other relatives". This was a figurative, expressionist collection, with a lot of colour, where she mixes oil paints with sand, coffee, sawdust, plants, insects and other materials. Her painting is inspired by animals and nature, and her canvases are often transferred to the prints in the collections presented at Cibeles Madrid Fashion Week and her sculptures inspire the designs of the company’s jewellery.

In 2009, she founded the Corporate Social Responsibility Department (CSR) at Adolfo Dominguez S.A. Her achievements include the publication of the Animal Welfare Policy (2010). Through this document, the company rejects the use of exotic animal skins, as well as violent activities or animal abuse, such as plucking feathers from live birds or mulesing. They only use leather for bags and accessories, provided that it has certification that it comes from animals bred for food.
