On 1 June 1918 Porch married Lady Randolph Churchill, the mother of Winston Churchill.  There was a substantial age difference, as Porch was 41 and Lady Randolph (Jennie Jerome) was 64. This was Jennie's third marriage, Porch's first. In her final years, Jennie Porch ran up large debts, as her spending was far higher than the regular cheques for £60 Porch was sending her.  The couple remained married for three years, until Jennie's death in 1921. After her death, her sister  Leonie Leslie commented that "It is Winston who weeps copiously, but it is Jack, his brother, and poor Porchy who are paying off her debts."A Roman Catholic, in 1926 Porch married secondly Donna Giulia Patrizi, the only daughter of the Marchese Patrizi della Rocco, and lived in Italy until she died in 1938. He then returned to Glastonbury where he died in November 1964, aged 87. Until the end, he avoided all discussion of his life with his first wife.
