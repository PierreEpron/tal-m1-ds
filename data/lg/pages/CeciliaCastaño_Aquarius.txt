La situación de las mujeres en el mercado de trabajo y el impacto de las tecnologías de la información (Difference or Discrimination: The Situation of Women in the Labor Market and the Impact of Information Technologies).From 2000 to 2005 Castaño directed research projects at the University of Seville's Regional Development Institute, and from 2000 to 2006 at the University of Alcalá's Service Sector Research Laboratory (Servilab).

== Second digital divide ==
Castaño has dedicated several works to the analysis of the gender digital divide, and has investigated and warned about the existence of the "second digital gender gap", referring not only to inequality in access, but also in the different use that men and women make of technology.

The relevance of the first division or digital divide is related above all to the quality of Internet access. But the technical availability and the quality of the access are a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for access. Access to the Internet is a social phenomenon and the social conditions of access are important. Among them, the most relevant is the ability to use technologies, what we have called digital literacy or digital fluency, which constitute the cutting lines of the second digital division.
