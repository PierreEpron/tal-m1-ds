However, on 22 March 2019, he was appointed as assistant manager of NAC Breda under newly appointed interim manager Ruud Brood for the rest of the season. The plan was that Vrede would leave NAC Breda at the end of the 2018–19 season, to start the new 2019–20 season as the manager of SV Limburgia. However, he ended up combining the two jobs, being in charge of Limburgia and continuing as an assistant coach at NAC. However, on 31 December 2019, he was fired from NAC.After leaving NAC, Vrede continued in his position as a manager SV Limburgia, which he had been since July 2019.
