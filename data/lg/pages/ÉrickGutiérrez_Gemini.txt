== Style of play ==
A left-footed box-to-box midfielder who can also play as a deep-lying playmaker and the holding role, Gutiérrez started off his career as a defensive midfielder until then-Pachuca manager Diego Alonso opted to play him in a more advanced position. A versatile, intelligent, and creative player, he is good at reading the game, capable of picking out and completing key passes, possesses superb positioning, links plays together using his technical ability and vision on the ball, denies opposing advances, is capable of shooting from long-range, and is able to make dribbling runs from deep. His level of composure and maturity despite a young age has been shown in the leadership roles he assumes, captaining the Mexico U-20 team as well as his former club, Pachuca.Gutiérrez has been compared to national team compatriot Andrés Guardado.
