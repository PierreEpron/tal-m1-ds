Stallman was raised in the vicinity of Kankakee. He served in the US Army from September 16, 1952 to September 7, 1954.Stallman received a bachelor's degree in English in 1957  and a master's degree in English in 1961, both from the University of New Mexico, and a Ph.D. from the University of Oregon in 1966.

Stallman died in Kalamazoo.


== Literary career ==
Stallman's literary reputation is founded on his Book of the Beast trilogy, written late in life and published in part posthumously. According to Peter Nicholls the work is "an engrossing series" of "complex, sensitively written Fabulations, fitting between the generic borders of sf and Horror, and update the myth of the Werewolf with [an] sf premise." He finds the final volume "awkwardly structured," however, judging it "needed a auctorial revision which it could not be given" due to Stallman's premature death.
