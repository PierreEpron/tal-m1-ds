AnonymousCulture originally went by the stage name Anonymous????. In 2009, he added Culture to the pseudonym to articulate his strong belief embracing individuality.

Be You!...No matter your age or race, I just want them (people) to stand out by being themselves".In 2009, the newly named AnonymousCulture released a series of mixtapes, The Anonymous Files Volume I and II, and a single, “Stacks,” to bloggers and hip hop fans. In 2010, he released his first original body of work entitled The Intervention. The name came from the idea that music had lost its way and needed a change.
