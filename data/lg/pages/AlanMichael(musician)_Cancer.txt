== Biography ==
Matković was born on 20 July 1970 in Rijeka, SR Croatia, SFR Yugoslavia to a Polish mother and a Yugoslav father. He moved to the Netherlands in his early childhood and grew up in Zandvoort, North Holland. Matković began playing piano at the age of six, and recorded his first single when he was twelve years old. His second single, "Is That You", was released by the record label Warner-Elektra-Atlantic (WEA) in 1987.In the same year, he represented the Netherlands in the Sopot International Song Festival with the song "Romeo and Juliet", alongside Maywood with the song "Stay with Me". For his performance, he was awarded the "FIDOF Award". Due to his participation in the Sopot Festival, Matković gained popularity in Poland, and "Romeo and Juliet" was released on single by the Polish record label Arston. One year later, he released his self-titled debut album with the Polish record label Pronit. The songs "Sandy" and "Dreams of Love" from this album also appeared on his second album The Winning Edge, and were released on single by CBS Records International in 1989.Following the release of The Winning Edge, Matković was signed to the Hilversum-based record label Red Bullet. In 1992, a third studio album, titled One for a While, was released. Despite successes in Eastern Europe, such as a gold record in Poland, Matković never broke through as a singer in the Netherlands. In April 1993, he featured in the television documentary Hoera, een hit ("Hooray, a hit") by the Dutch broadcaster VARA, which documented his efforts to produce a hit in his home country.A few days before the documentary was broadcast, Matković had competed in the Nationaal Songfestival – the Dutch national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest – as one of the songwriters of the entry "Medeleven", which finished in fourth place. He subsequently began pursuing a career as a songwriter and founded his own recording studio, AM Studios, in Zandvoort. Between 1997 and 2005, he competed in the Nationaal Songfestival six times, winning it twice as a songwriter of the entries "One Good Reason" (1999) and "One More Night" (2003). The songs finished in 8th and 13th place in the Eurovision Song Contest, and "One More Night" received a Marcel Bezençon Award for the best entry according to previous winners of the contest.
