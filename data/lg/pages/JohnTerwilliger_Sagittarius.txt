Terwilliger qualified for the 1980 U.S. Olympic team but was unable to compete due to the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott. In 2007, he received one of 461 Congressional Gold Medals created especially for the spurned athletes. He was a member of the American men's eights team that won the silver medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California.  Terwilliger also participated in the men's coxed fours at the 1988 Summer Olympics and placed 5th overall. He spent his college career rowing for Seattle Pacific University, where he was a member of that school's first crew to participate in a national regatta, the Dad Vail.
