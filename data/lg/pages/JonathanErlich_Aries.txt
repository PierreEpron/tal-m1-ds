== Team Participation ==


=== Davis Cup ===

Israel was represented by Erlich, Ram, Dudi Sela, and Harel Levy.  Russia's lineup consisted of Marat Safin (# 24 in the world; former world # 1), Igor Andreev (26), Igor Kunitsyn (35), and Mikhail Youzhny (44; former world # 8).  The stage was set by Safin, who prior to the tie told the press:  "With all due respect, Israel was lucky to get to the quarterfinals."  The Israeli team's response was to beat the Russian team in each of their first three matches, thereby winning the tie.  Levy, world # 210, beat Russia's top player, Andreev, world # 24, 6–4, 6–2, 4–6, 6–2 in the opening match.  Sela (# 33) followed by beating Russian Youzhny 3–6, 6–1, 6–0, 7–5.  Israeli captain Eyal Ran likened his players to two fighter jets on court, saying:  "I felt as if I had two F-16s out there today, they played amazingly well." The match was attended by 10,500 people, the largest ever crowd ever for a tennis match held in Israel.  The next day Erlich and Ram beat Safin and Kunitsyn 6–3, 6–4, 6–7, 4–6, 6–4 in front of a boisterous crowd of over 10,000.  "This is something I will cherish for all of my life," said Erlich.  He added, "Everybody has dreams, but there are some you don’t allow yourself to have, and beating Russia 3–0 was just like that .. but we have done it."  Even the Saudi Gazette described the doubles match as a "thrilling" win.  Ran was carried shoulder-high around the Tel Aviv stadium, as the 10,000-strong crowd applauded.  With the tie clinched for Israel, the reverse singles rubbers were "dead", and instead of best-of-five matches, best-of-three sets were played, with the outcomes of little to no importance.  Israel wrapped up a 4–1 victory over Russia, as Levy defeated Kunitsyn 6–4, 4–6, 7–6, while Sela retired with a wrist injury while down 3–4 in the first set against Andreev.
