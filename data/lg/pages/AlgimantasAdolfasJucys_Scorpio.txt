Algimantas Adolfas Jucys (14 November 1936 – 29 July 1997) was a Lithuanian theoretical physicist  more prominent as a  mathematician, a son of Lithuanian physicist Adolfas Jucys. Since 1967 Algis Jucys was researcher at the Institute of Physics and Mathematics of Lithuanian Academy of Sciences, in 1977-1990 at the Institute of Physics and in 1990-1996 at the Institute of Theoretical Physics and Astronomy, Lithuania.Algimantas (Algis) Adolfas (A.-A.A.)
