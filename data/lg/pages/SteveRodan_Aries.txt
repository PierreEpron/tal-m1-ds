== Early life and career ==
Born on 19 April 1954 in Glasgow to Robert W. Rodan and Betty Rodan (née Turner), he is a qualified pharmacist.
Rodan was educated at the High School of Glasgow and the University of Edinburgh, before graduating from Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, with a BSc (Hons) in pharmacy.
After graduating, in 1978, Rodan began practising as a pharmacist in Elgin, Morayshire. In 1980, he moved to Bermuda and worked as a pharmacy manager until moving to the Isle of Man.
Since 1987 Rodan has resided in Laxey, the most populated village in Garff, where he is the proprietor of a pharmacy. Politically he is a liberal, having chaired both the Heriot-Watt University Liberal Club and Scottish Young Liberals. He was also a Member of the National Executive of the Scottish Liberal Party. He stood for the House of Commons in 1979 in the constituency of Moray and Nairn, but was defeated by the Conservative Alexander Pollock.
Rodan was first elected as Member of the House of Keys for Garff in 1995, and re-elected in 1996, 2001, 2006, and 2011.
In 2006, Rodan, then Minister of Health and Social Security, was instrumental in enfranchising 16 and 17 year olds when he moved a successful amendment to Clause 3 of the Registration of Electors Bill, a piece of legislation intended to provide for the rolling registration of electors, resulting in the lowering of the voting age.
Rodan stood for Chief Minister of the Isle of Man following the November 2006 elections, but failed to gain the necessary support in round one. He then stood for Speaker and defeated David Cannan and Quintin Gill.
Rodan was elected as President of Tynwald on 19 June 2016 for a period of five years. Rodan presided over his final Tynwald Day on July 5, 2021, prior to standing down from the post. He was replaced as President of Tynwald by Laurence Skelly.
Rodan was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2019 Birthday Honours for services to the Isle of Man.
