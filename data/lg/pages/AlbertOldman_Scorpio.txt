Albert Leonard Oldman (18 November 1883 â€“ 15 January 1961) was an English super heavyweight boxer in the 1908 Olympics in London for Great Britain.


== Biography ==
Oldman was born in Mile End, London in 1883. His passage to Olympic gold was one of the smoothest ever as he knocked out his first rival within a minute. He received a bye in the semi-final and defeated Sydney Evans, his fellow Briton, in less than two minutes in the final.
Oldman, who served in the Royal Horse Guards, later became a policeman in the City of London Police. He emigrated to join the Ceylon force in 1910.
He died on 15 January 1961, at the age of 77, in Upminster, London.
