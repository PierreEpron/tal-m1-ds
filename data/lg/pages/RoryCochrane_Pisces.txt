Cochrane's first roles included a part in a docudrama about drugs on Saturday Night with Connie Chung (1989) and an appearance in an episode of H.E.L.P. (1990). He then made his film debut (with about fifteen seconds' screen time) in A Kiss Before Dying, followed by his first substantial role as Jeff Goldblum's son in Fathers & Sons.
Cochrane's breakout role came when he was cast as stoner Ron Slater in 1993's Dazed and Confused, a film that Entertainment Weekly ranked #3 in their "50 Best High School Movies" of all-time. Cochrane followed up with a powerful performance as the psychotic Billy Mack in the Renée Zellweger action/comedy Love and a .45 in 1994. Cochrane again found success with a major role in the poorly-received Empire Records and appeared in Hart's War starring Bruce Willis and Colin Farrell. He also appeared in the Richard Linklater film A Scanner Darkly (2006).
Cochrane played the role of CSI Tim Speedle in CSI: Miami seasons 1–3. Cochrane also reprised his role in the season 6 episode "Bang, Bang, Your Debt", as a hallucination to Eric Delko.
In 2015, Cochrane had a supporting role as Boston mobster Stephen Flemmi in the true-crime film Black Mass, which starred Johnny Depp.
