Brooks and Allan Burns during the early 1970s – shows like The Mary Tyler Moore Show, The Partridge Family, Love, American Style and The Bob Newhart Show She was part of a universe of women writers that included Pat Nardo, Gail Parent, Susan Silver, and Treva Silverman.
In the late 1960s and early 1970s, it was unusual to find a woman inside the writers' room of a primetime network television show other than secretaries and personal assistants. A notable exception was Madelyn Pugh, who wrote for the I Love Lucy series. After the success of Treva Silverman, some showrunners began to actively recruit women writers. One of them was James L. Brooks who hired Brown to write an episode of The Mary Tyler Moore Show. Assignments soon followed on The Sandy Duncan Show, The Partridge Family, and The Bob Newhart Show. For many of the series in which she worked, Brown was often the first woman writer that had ever been hired by that particular producer.When Brooks created Rhoda, a spin-off of The Mary Tyler Moore Show, Brown was hired as a staff writer.
