Claudio Sala (Italian pronunciation: [ˈklaudjo ˈsaːla]; born 8 September 1947) is a former Italian footballer, manager and current commentator, who played as a winger.


== Club career ==
He made his debut for Monza, later moving to Napoli, Torino and Genoa. In total he played 323 matches and scored 27 goals in the Serie A. With Torino, he won the 1975–76 Serie A, and the 1970–71 Coppa Italia.


== International career ==
He also earned 18 caps for the Italy national football team, including playing in the 1978 FIFA World Cup, where Italy finished in fourth place after reaching the semi-final.


== Style of play ==
Nicknamed "il poeta del gol" ("the goal poet," in Italian), Sala was usually deployed as a winger, but could also play as an attacking midfielder, or even as a main or supporting striker on occasion. Regarded as one of Italy's greatest wingers, he was a quick, powerful, and highly creative player, and an excellent assist provider. He had good technical ability, as well as accurate passing and crossing ability, which allowed him to be an effective playmaker. As a two-footed player, he was capable of attacking on either wing, and was known for his ability to get past his opponents and deliver balls into the penalty area from the touchline.
