Moon Young-nam (born March 13, 1960) is a South Korean television screenwriter. Moon began writing dramas in the early 1990s, but it was Terms of Endearment (2004) and My Rosy Life (2005) that brought her praise for taking clichéd and predictable tearjerker plots (Korean: 신파; RR: shinpa) and making them into powerful melodramas with a fresh spin, filled with ironically named characters. In her dramas, Moon often delves into the harsh realities of married life with candidness and wit, and her style has been consistently popular with local audiences, resulting in high viewership ratings for Famous Princesses (2006), First Wives' Club (2007), Three Brothers (2009) and Wang's Family (2013).
