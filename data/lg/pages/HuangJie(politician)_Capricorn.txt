Huang is known for criticizing Han Kuo-yu's plan to establish a free economic zone in Kaohsiung in a viral video where she rolled her eyes after Han seemed unable or unwilling to give details about his plan.  She left the New Power Party on August 26, 2020.On February 6, 2021, she faced an unsuccessful Kuomintang-led recall attempt, with 65,256 voting against the recall versus 55,394 voting in favor and a 41.54% turnout; furthermore the number of votes in favor of the recall did not meet the required threshold of 25% of eligible voters, or 72,892 votes.  The recall attempt was viewed by Huang's supporters as retaliation for her role in the successful recall of former mayor Han Kuo-yu.
