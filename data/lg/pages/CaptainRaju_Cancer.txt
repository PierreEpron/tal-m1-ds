== Film career ==
Captain Raju first acted in an unreleased Hindi movie along with Tariq (Yaadon Ki Baraat fame) in 1980 as the supporting hero even before he made his break in Malayalam movies. Raju made his debut in Malayalam with the 1981 multi-starrer movie Raktham. The co-actor in the movie Madhu was greatly impressed with his performance. This made Madhu cast him as the hero in his first home production Rathilayam, which was a movie with A-listers of that era including Soman, Shanavas Rajkumar and Menaka. Captain Raju played the hero role in the movie with Silk Smitha as his heroine. Many B-grade films were made inspired by Rathilayam with Raju himself playing the lead in such low-budget masala films towards the late eighties.But Captain Raju had established himself as a popular actor even before this phase. His first memorable role came out in the 1984 movie Athiratram, where he played a lead role along with Mamootty and Mohanlal. He also played some of the popular villain characters during this era. In the 1986 movie Aavanazhi, he played the villain role of Sathyaraj which was well appreciated. The grand success of this movie made him one of the busiest actors in Malayalam cinema. It was in the 1988 movie August 1 where Raju probably played the biggest villain role in his career. Raju's act as the unnamed killer determined to assassinate the Kerala Chief Minister was one of the high points of the film. It is considered one of the best villain characters in Malayalam cinema. In the movie Samryajyam, he played an antagonist gangster opposite to that of Mammootty. Khalid in Vyooham (1990) and Pathrose in Adwaitham (1992) were some of the other noted villain characters portrayed by him during the early 90s. His role as Aringodar of Oru Vadakkan Veeragatha was one of the characters which helped Captain Raju to change his track from villain characters (other being Pavanai). This movie helped him to reveal his true potential as a character actor. He also had a notable role in the 1988 movie Oru CBI Diary Kurippu. Captain Raju eventually stopped acting in villain roles during the early 90's. With the 1994 movie Kabooliwala , he became more selective and his role as Madassery Thampi in Puthukkottayile Puthumanavalan was a clear step towards this. He is also known for portraying the powerful elder brother role in the 1993 movie Uppukandam Brothers.Raju is also known for playing some of the memorable comic characters. He became a household name in Malayalam cinema after his brief role as the comical assassin Pavanayi in Nadodikkattu. The character eventually attained a cult status in Kerala. The classic dialogue "Pavanayi Shavamayi” (Pavanayi is dead) along with the terms such as Malappuram Kathi, Ambum Villum, Transistor Bomb is still popular. His character as Karunan Chandakavala (Detective Karamchand) in the 2003 slapstick CID Moosa also got appreciated. Captain Raju reprised his iconic character Pavanayi in the movie Mr. Pavanayi 99.99. The movie's production was completed in 2012, but was released only a year after his death in 2019 due to some issues with producer. This was also his second movie as a director with the first being Oru Snehagadha released in 1997. Captain Raju's last movie was the 2017 Mammootty starrer Masterpiece, where he appeared as himself after a four-year break, as he was recovering from a road accident injury.
