Blackwell was at the center of controversy during the 2004 Republican National Convention, when he passed out Purple Heart bandages which were perceived by some as denigrating the award. The Kerry campaign attacked the activity as the Republican Party mocking United States soldiers. Karl Rove called Blackwell's bandages "inappropriate".Blackwell is considered something of a specialist in matters relating to the rules of the Republican Party. He served on rules committees of the state Republican parties in Louisiana and Virginia. He serves now on the Standing Committee on Rules of the Republican National Committee and has attended every meeting of the RNC rules committees since 1972.In the 2016 Republican presidential primary, Blackwell endorsed Ted Cruz.
