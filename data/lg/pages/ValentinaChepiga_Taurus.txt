== Bodybuilding career ==


=== Amateur ===
Valentina began bodybuilding in 1988, and in 1992 she changed careers and became a personal trainer. Valentina won the European and World Amateur title in 1997 and won her IFBB pro card.


=== Professional ===
She then made her professional debut at the 1998 Ms. Olympia contest, finishing in 12th place.  Her greatest success as a professional has been winning the heavyweight class at the 2000 Ms. Olympia the first time that class was introduced to the Ms. Olympia.  No overall winner was named for that show, so she was essentially co-Ms. Olympia with lightweight class winner Andrulla Blanchette. In 2002, she took part in Ms. International, where she won the lightweight class. After a three-year break from competition, Chepiga returned to the stage at the 2007 Ms. Olympia, placing eleventh.
