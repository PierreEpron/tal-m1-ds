Riley played for Keyworth United before turning professional with Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest in June 1983. He played 12 First Division games for the club between April 1984 and 1987, scoring two goals. He was loaned out to Darlington in February 1987, and played six Third Division games for Cyril Knowles' side, scoring two goals. He joined Fourth Division side Peterborough United on loan in 1987, and played twelve league games under Noel Cantwell, scoring two goals.
He joined Third Division club Port Vale in October 1987, manager John Rudge splashing out £20,000. He scored on his debut at Vale Park in a 2–1 win over Bristol Rovers on 19 October. He became the club's joint-top scorer in the 1987–88 season with 10 goals, along with Darren Beckford. He then switched to left-wing to cover for the injured Paul Atkinson. He played 48 league and cup games in the 1988–89 season, but broke his leg in a 1–1 draw at Bolton Wanderers on 25 April 1989, and so missed out on the play-off final victory over Bristol Rovers. He managed to recover, but did not re-capture his first team position and in March 1990 was loaned back to Peterborough United, who were then under Mark Lawrenson's stewardship; Peterborough paid £40,000 for his services on a permanent basis the next month.He won promotion with the "Posh" in 1990–91, helping Chris Turner's side to the fourth and final promotion place in the Fourth Division.

Riley then joined Conference National club Kettering Town, and later played for F.C. Ponsonby in New Zealand, before returning to England with non-league sides Boston United and King's Lynn.
