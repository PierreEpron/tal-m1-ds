Born in Guelma, Sayoud began his career in 2002 in the youth ranks of local club Nasr El Fedjoudj. He then played for Rapid de Guelma and ES Guelma before moving to ES Sétif.
While at Sétif, he saw a television commercial for try outs being held in Algiers for the 'Play Maker Academy' in Ismaïlia, Egypt. Of the 80 people trying out, Sayoud made the top 5 and was sent to train with 108 other players from the Arab world in Ismaïlia. After four months of training, only 35 players were chosen to stay, with Sayoud being among them. The remaining players continued training and participating in matches with Sayoud being chosen as the top player among the group.
He was approached by a number of clubs including Al-Ahly, Ismaily, Al-Ahli Dubai and Al Ain. Sayoud decided to join Al-Ahli Dubai, signing a 4-year contract with the club. During his brief time in the United Arab Emirates, his potential was quickly identified by Egyptian club Al-Ahly.

On 23 June 2009, Al-Ahly announced the signing of Sayoud on a five-year contract.

However, Al-Ahly decided to cancel the deal with Benjelloun and registered Sayoud in the squad list for the 2009–10 season.He made his debut with the first team in the second league game against El Geish on 11 September 2009 coming on as a substitute for Francis Doe in the 75th minute. After only 10 minutes in his debut, he gained his first yellow card.

I promise to repay their faith and live up to expectations."
