== Dakar rally ==
In 2009, he coordinated the transference of the Dakar Rally, the world's most popular Rally race from northern Africa to Argentina and Chile. The change in location has dramatically altered the character of the race. Although the goal is the same, following a pre-determined 9000 km path through treacherous terrain, drivers would sometimes go for days in North Africa without seeing spectators. In 2009, on the first day over 500,000 Argentines filled the streets of Buenos Aires to watch the trucks, cars and motorcyclists start the event. It is estimated that over the three million Argentines lined the race course over the next fourteen days.
