Graham Victor Harold Moffatt (6 December 1919 – 2 July 1965) was an English comedic character actor. He is best known for a number of films where he appeared with Will Hay and Moore Marriott as 'Albert': a plump cheekily insolent street-savvy youth.


== Early life ==
Moffatt was born on 6 December 1919 in Hammersmith, West London, the son of Frederick Victor Moffatt (1896–1977) and Daisy Eleonora née Whiteside (1895–1969), both of whom outlived him. He had two sisters, one being Rita Doreen Moffatt (1936–1991). He was born exactly 31 years after Will Hay, with whom Moffatt would perform with in a string of successful cinema films in the 1930s. He wanted to act from an early age. He first worked as a call boy at Shepherd's Bush Studios, and often saw actor Tom Walls going in and out of the sound stages. Walls took a liking to Moffatt, and chose him for a bit part in the 1934 film A Cup of Kindness. He then gave up his job as a call boy, and went on to appear in five more films in minor, mostly uncredited roles before getting his big break in Will Hay's films.


== Cinema career ==
His first film with Will Hay was Where There's a Will (1936) in which he plays an office boy. In his next film with Hay, Windbag the Sailor (1936), he is joined by Moore Marriott and his character has become 'Albert'. He is known by this name in all his later films with Hay and Marriott: Oh, Mr Porter! (1937), Old Bones of the River (1938), Convict 99 (1938), Ask a Policeman (1939) and Where's That Fire? (1940). Still as Albert, he appeared again with Moore Marriott in a series of films starring Arthur Askey: Charley's (Big-Hearted) Aunt (1940), I Thank You (1941), and Back Room Boy (1942). His later films include Powell and Pressburger's A Canterbury Tale and I Know Where I'm Going!.


== Post-acting life ==
In the mid-1940s he semi-retired from show business to become a publican with his wife, Joyce Muriel Hazeldine, whom he married in June 1948 and remained married to for 17 years until his death in July 1965. Together, they ran the Swan Inn at Braybrooke (near Market Harborough), followed by the Englishcombe Inn at Bath. Whilst landlord of the Swan Inn, Moffatt became good friends with local musician and actor Jim Dale who would often drink at the pub.In March 1952 he was admitted to hospital in Kettering after two weeks of hiccuping (spasms of the diaphragm). He still made sporadic cinema film appearances in minor parts, the last being in the 1963 film 80,000 Suspects, directed by Val Guest, who was a writer of many of the films that Moffatt starred in with Will Hay and Moore Marriott.


== Personal life and death ==
Moffatt married Joyce Muriel Hazeldine in 1948.  He died on 2 July 1965 in Bath, Somerset from heart failure at the early age of 45. His ashes were scattered in the English Channel at the village of Beer in Devon.  He is survived by his three children Richard, Jayne and Chris.
