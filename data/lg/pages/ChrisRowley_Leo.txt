Christopher Ryan Rowley (born August 14, 1990) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Toronto Blue Jays. He is also a first lieutenant in the United States Army, assigned to the Individual Ready Reserve (IRR). Upon his major-league debut in August 2017, Rowley became the first West Point graduate to play in MLB.


== High school and college ==
Rowley attended South Forsyth High School in Cumming, Georgia, where he set school records in wins, earned run average (ERA), and strikeouts. After high school, Rowley was offered college baseball scholarships by Mercer University and the United States Military Academy (also called West Point). He chose the Military Academy over Mercer, as the Army Black Knights offered him a chance to start games, while the Mercer Bears wanted him in the bullpen, working as a relief pitcher. In his first season with Army, he appeared in three games for the Black Knights and posted a 13.00 ERA in nine innings pitched. The following year, Rowley pitched to a 5–4 win–loss record, 4.68 ERA, and 54 strikeouts in 73 total innings. Rowley finished the 2012 campaign with an 11–1 record, which included six complete games and five shutouts, and added a 2.40 earned run average and 80 strikeouts in 971⁄3 innings. Following the season, he was named the Patriot League's Pitcher of the Year. In his final season with the Black Knights, Rowley went 9–4 with a 2.67 ERA and 75 strikeouts in 972⁄3 innings pitched.
