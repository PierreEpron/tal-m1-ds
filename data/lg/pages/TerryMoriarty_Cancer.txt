== Notes ==
a  Due to a large number of players being unavailable due to military service, the WANFL was limited to players under the age of 18 years for three seasons from 1942 to 1944. Games played and awards won during this period of time are still counted as official.
b  Cyril Hoft of Perth tied with Tom Outridge for the 1921 medal, but lost on countback, having played less games. Hoft was retrospectively awarded a medal in 1997, so is technically the first Perth player to win the award.
