== Biography ==
Connie Brockway was born on December 16, 1954, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, but spent several years in suburban Buffalo, New York. Her family returned to Edina, Minnesota, where she attended high school. In 1976, Brockway received a B.A. from Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota. While earning an M.A. in Creative Writing at the University of Minnesota, she met her future husband, David Brockway, medical student, now a family physician. They married in November 1976. They have a daughter. The couple currently live in Minnesota.
Brockway decided to take a year and try to write a book once her daughter entered school. In 1994, Brockway published her first book, Promise Me Heaven. Over 1.5 million copies of her books are now in print, and they can be found in thirteen countries. Brockway has been a finalist for the Romance Writers of America's RITA Award eight times, winning twice. Although Brockway made her mark with historical romance, in 2005 she announced that she would take a hiatus from historical romance and begin writing contemporary romance novels.
