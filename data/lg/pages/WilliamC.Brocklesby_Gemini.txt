William Claiborne Brocklesby was born May 28, 1847, in Hartford, Connecticut. He attended the public schools of Hartford before entering Trinity College, where his father, John Brocklesby, was a professor. After his graduation in 1869, he studied in the office of New York architect Richard Upjohn. In 1878, he established his own practice in Hartford. He practiced alone until 1904, when he established a partnership with H. Hilliard Smith, an employee of several years. Brocklesby & Smith was active until Brocklesby's death in late 1910. The following year, Smith would reorganize the office as Smith & Bassette.
Brocklesby was elected an associate of the American Institute of Architects in 1901. He died in Hartford on October 9, 1910.
