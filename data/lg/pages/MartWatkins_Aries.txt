Along with his elder brother Ernie, Mart played for his local club, Oswestry Town where he was spotted by Football League side Stoke. He signed in August 1900 and with the "Potters" awful start to the 1900–01 season – one point from the first seven games – ensured a rapid entrance to first team football. Tall and slim with a neat moustache, Watkins was described as a 'smart player', possessing a whiplash shot who pass to his winger before dashing back into the penalty area to launch himself at the ensuing cross.Watkins helped Stoke avoid relegation in 1900–01, scoring the winning goal in the team's last three matches. In 1901–02 he finished top scorer with 16 and repeated the feat with 13 in 1902–03 which earned him some Welsh caps. In January 1904 Manchester City offered Stoke £450 for Watkins' services. The deal collapsed, but with Stoke desperate for funds following the construction of a new stand Aston Villa manager George Ramsey signed Watkins for a 'high price' joining up with former Stoke winger Arthur Lockett.His career at Villa Park didn't last long after playing just six matches scoring once, ironically against Stoke, he signed for Sunderland in October 1904.

He scored five goals in 20 matches as a Stoke endured a terrible 1907–08 which saw the supporters abandon the team and the club entered liquidation, resigning from the Football League in the process.
