David Storrier (25 October 1872 – 27 January 1910) was a Scottish footballer who played for Arbroath, Everton, Celtic, Dundee, Millwall Athletic and Scotland. Storrier cost a Scottish record transfer fee of £320 in 1898 when Celtic signed him from Everton (where he played on the losing side in the 1897 FA Cup Final), and he went on to win the Scottish Cup in 1899 and 1900 with the Glasgow club. He was a keen cricketer, playing at Scottish county level; he suffered a serious injury in 1902 when struck on the head by a ball.
