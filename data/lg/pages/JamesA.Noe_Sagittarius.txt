James Albert Noe Sr. (December 21, 1890 – October 18, 1976) was an American businessman and politician from Louisiana, who was briefly the 43rd Governor of Louisiana following the death of Oscar K. Allen in 1936.
Noe was born on December 21, 1890, near West Point, Kentucky. He made his fortune in oil and ran for the Louisiana State Senate at the request of Huey Long. He was chosen as president pro tempore of the senate and succeeded to the governorship to finish out Allen's term, since the lieutenant governor had been elected to the state Supreme Court.
During his brief term in office, he appointed Huey Long's widow, Rose McConnell Long, to fill his seat in the U.S. Senate. He also worked on obtaining federal money for state highways and establishing a state welfare office.
Noe ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1940 and 1959 but had more success in his business ventures. Following his governorship, Noe founded WNOE in New Orleans, Louisiana and KNOE in Monroe, Louisiana, both named in his honor.
Noe died in Houston, Texas, on October 18, 1976 from complications from a heart condition. His son, James A. Noe, Jr., succeeded him in running the family-owned radio and television stations.
