She is the first singer from Kosovo to represent Albania in the contest. Because of the Qafa e Vishës bus tragedy, RTSH deferred the first semi-final by more than two hours on 22 May, resulting in low ratings during Nishliu's appearance. Albania used its jury votes to vote for the other 17 countries in the semi-final, and it used the jury votes again on 26 May. RTK also did not air highlights from the first semi-final due to the bus crash.
