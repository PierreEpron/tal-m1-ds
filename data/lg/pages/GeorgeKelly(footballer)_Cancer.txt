== Career ==
Kelly started his career at his home town side Aberdeen before joining Stoke City in 1955. Kelly had a relatively short spell at the Victoria Ground but he managed to get a fine goal per game ratio of 35 goals in 67 games in the Second Division. He later joined Cardiff City but after the club made a poor start to the 1958–59 season, he lost his place in the side to Derek Tapscott and left to join Stockport County at the end of the season. After he retired from football, Kelly started playing tennis with Johnny King and the pair almost made the 1970 Wimbledon Championships.
