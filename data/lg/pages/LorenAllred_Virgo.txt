In 2014, she worked as a playback singer and member of the recording ensemble for a film musical being developed by the Broadway songwriting team of Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. After working on early demos, she was cast as the singing voice of Rebecca Ferguson's character, Jenny Lind, on the project The Greatest Showman. The film soundtrack and song were successful, going Platinum and the soundtrack topping the Billboard albums chart in January 2018. That same month, "Never Enough" (Allred's featured song) reached number 88 on the Hot 100.Allred's vocal performance of "Never Enough" has received widespread acclaim.

In early 2019, Allred joined Michael Bublé's Love album for a duet of "Help Me Make it Through the Night." Bublé discovered Allred while watching The Greatest Showman and released a behind the scenes recording of their duet. Bublé noted that Allred has "the most beautiful voice and control".Allred joined Andrea Bocelli for selected performances on his 2021 USA Tour. In promoting the tour, he said: "If an artist wants to move the listener, he or she must have something intense and convincing to tell through the singing. This something comes from experiences and insight: it is the inner wealth that you can acquire by living. Loren Allred is a perfect example of this: her richly nuanced voice, her expressiveness, and her powers of communication describe and celebrate the beauty she has managed to cultivate within herself. A versatile musician raised in the arts, I remember how pleasantly surprised I was when we sang together for the first time in Saudi Arabia. I am delighted to soon be able to return to the stage with Loren, in that great country that is her homeland and my adoptive homeland."In 2022, Allred auditioned for the 15th series of Britain's Got Talent, performing "Never Enough". Simon Cowell said: "You sang one of the biggest songs of all time. Why didn't you get that big deal after the song?" She responded:

"I was more comfortable singing behind the scenes. But I feel kind of like the song was meant for me, and I'm kind of ready to put a face to the song. So I'm here to do that."
She received the Golden Buzzer from Amanda Holden, sending her through to the semifinals. She won her semifinal on 2 June and competed in the final, finishing in ninth place.
