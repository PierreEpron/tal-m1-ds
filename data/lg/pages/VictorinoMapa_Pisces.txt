Victorino Montaño Mapa (February 25, 1855 – April 12, 1927) was an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines and later, as the second Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines under the American colonial Insular Government.


== Career ==
He was homeschooled during his childhood. Later, he earned his Bachelor of Arts from Colegio de San Juan de Letran and his degree of Bachelor of Laws and Jurisprudence from the University of Santo Tomas at the age of 25.
He was appointed an associate justice of the newly created Supreme Court of the Philippines in 1901, together with Cayetano Arellano and Florentino Torres. He left the Supreme Court to be Secretary of Finance and Justice in 1913 during which he also served on the Philippine Commission, the upper house of the Philippine Legislature.
Upon Arellano's retirement in 1920, he was appointed the second Chief Justice. His tenure was brief, as his frail health forced him to retire early on October 31, 1921. He died on April 12, 1927. On April 29, or 17 days later, his fellow retired justice, Florentino Torres, also died.


== Legacy ==
Victorino Mapa High School, Victorino Mapa Street, and the nearby V. Mapa LRT Station, all in Manila, are named after him.
