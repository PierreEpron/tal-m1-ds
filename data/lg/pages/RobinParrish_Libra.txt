== Biography ==
Robin Parrish was born in Thomasville, North Carolina, to Michael Wayland Parrish and Lutricia Jones Parrish. His earliest writing efforts took place on a plastic, toy typewriter, and resulted in several "books" (most between 10 and 30 pages long) and even a few magazines.
By the age of thirteen, he had begun winning local writing awards and became a regular in his high school's literary magazine. In college, he garnered acclaim from his English professors and fellow students while maturing and honing his skills.
It was his own website creation Infuze, that led to becoming a published author. One of his more "high concept" ideas for Infuze was to return to his love for storytelling and create a serialized tale that would play out every two weeks, telling a complete, compelling story over the course of nine months. That serialized story eventually came to the attention of several publishers, who saw it as a potential debut novel for Robin Parrish.
In 2005, Bethany House Publishers brought Parrish full circle by contracting him for the rights to not only that first book—but two sequels. A trilogy, to unfold in the consecutive summers of 2006, 2007, and 2008. One massive tale—of which that first, original story would form only the foundational first volume of the three—spread across three books.
