=== Club ===
Torres began his career with UDA Gramenet before joining Valencia CF in 1997. He was a regular with the B team for two seasons, being loaned out to Recreativo de Huelva and CD Tenerife the next two years. In the latter, alongside Mista and Luis García, he was a key member of the Canary Islands club – coached by Rafael Benítez– that won promotion to La Liga.
Torres then returned to Valencia, where he proceeded to become a key member in the sides that won the national league twice and the 2003–04 UEFA Cup, again under Benítez. From early 2005 onwards, however, he would be severely hindered by injuries, although he appeared in 17 games in the 2006–07 campaign, mainly as a left-back due to Emiliano Moretti's forced absence.
For 2007–08, Torres was loaned to top-flight newcomers Real Murcia, where his physical problems resurfaced (two league appearances). Upon their relegation he returned to Valencia, being restricted to two UEFA Cup matches during the season, with even midfielder Hedwiges Maduro being preferred as Miguel's backup; he left the Che in June 2009.
On 27 July 2009, Torres moved to Gimnàstic de Tarragona of Segunda División, playing no minutes whatsoever in the season (league or cup) as Nàstic finished in 18th position. In January of the following year, after the loan acquisitions of Borja Viguera and Álex Bergantiños by the club, the 34-year-old's contract was cancelled.


=== International ===
Courtesy of solid performances whilst at Valencia, Torres made his debut for Spain on 14 November 2001 in a friendly with Mexico in Huelva (1–0 win), and was a member of the 2002 FIFA World Cup squad, where he appeared against South Africa in the group stage.
