== Career ==


=== 2002–10: Calor Urbano ===
Garcia began his career in 2002 as a member of the Dominican group Calor Urbano, with whom he was a vocalist and composer, With the group recorded one album, which won several awards. The group was invited to tour with Juan Luis Guerra, which reinvigorated García's interest in traditional Dominican music and inspired him to incorporate genres such as bachata and merengue into his music. He noted, "That's when I realized that Dominican music has this power to make people dance and saw how people got really interested in our culture [through Guerra's music]". After touring with Calor Urbano, he returned to the Dominican Republic in 2010 and announced he was leaving the group to pursue a solo career.


=== 2010–2017: Solo career beginnings, Melodrama, and A La Mar ===

On August 9, 2010, García signed in Hollywood, California, with the label Capitol Latin, with whom he launched his first solo album titled Melodrama. On August 25 he released his first single, "Cómo Has Logrado". The album was released on October 26. García debuted as a soloist in front of over 14,000 people in the KQ Live Concert event in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he shared the stage with Juan Luis Guerra, Wisin y Yandel, Gilberto Santa Rosa and Kany García. On March 22, 2011, he performed alongside the Dominican-American urban bachata artist Prince Royce in the Casandra Awards.
His debut album, Melodrama, incorporated bachata rhythms with stylistic influences of other genres from around the world, such as bolero. For his second album A La Mar, García began collaborating with Calle 13 producer Visitante. The collaboration inspired García to deviate from mainstream bachata and incorporate a variety of genres into the album: the artist recalled, "I [didn't] want to be that guy that just does Caribbean music". García won three awards including Best New Artist at the 2017 Latin Grammy Awards. The song "Bachata en Kingston" from A La Mar won Best Tropical Song at the ceremony. A La Mar was ranked by the Los Angeles Times as the best album of the decade by any Dominican artist.


=== 2018–present: Trending Tropics side project and Candela ===
García continued his collaboration with Visitante on the experimental 2018 album Trending Tropics, which received critical acclaim. The pair experimented with a wide variety of musical genres on the record, ranging from "hip-hop to reggae, from merengue to disco, from choral music to fuzzy African rock". The lyrical content on Trending Topics was inspired by the complex relationship between humans and technology and features collaborations with Vetusta Morla, iLe, Ana Tijoux, Nidia Góngora.His 2019 release Candela was heavily influenced by merengue, a genre García called "the most important rhythm of the Dominican Republic". Seeking inspiration, García went to a state-owned music library to listen to preserved merengue phonographs. Through his studies, the singer learned about the diversity of merengue, including Haitian merengue derived from Angolan music. García hoped that by incorporating these styles on the record, he would demonstrate a "universalist perspective" through his music. At the 2019 Latin Grammy Awards Candela was nominated for Best Contemporary Tropical Album while the song "Ahí Ahí" was nominated for Record of the Year.
