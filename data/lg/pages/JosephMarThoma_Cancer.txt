== Early days ==


=== Palakunnathu family ===
Joseph Mar Thoma XXI came from an ecclesiastical family.
In the seventeenth century, a member of the Panamkuzhy house of Kuruvalingadu, Kuruvilla, came and settled in Kozhencherry on the banks of the Pampa river in Kerala. Later, he and his three sons moved to Maramon and lived at Chackkalyil on the other side of the river. The second son's second son in that family, Mathen, moved to a nearby house at Palakunnathu. He had six sons and two daughters. The daughter was married to the Mallapally Pavoothikunnel family, and the first four sons moved to Themoottil, Neduvelil (Kozhenchery), Periyilel, and Punamadom (Othera). The fifth son was a celibate priest (Sanyasi Achen). As was the custom, the youngest son Mathew lived at the Palakunnathu family house and married Pandanattu Mullasseril Mariamma. This house still exists.
A number of Malankara Church, and Marthoma Church leaders were also born in this family.  Abraham Malpan, a leader of reformation in the Malankara church was the second son of Mathew and Mariamma. Mar Thoma XIII was his nephew, his older brother's son. Thomas Mar Athanasius Metropolitan (Mar Thoma XIV) and Titus I Mar Thoma Metropolitan (Mar Thoma XV) were the sons of Abraham Malpan.
