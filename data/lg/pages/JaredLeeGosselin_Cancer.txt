Jared Lee Gosselin (born June 23, 1981) is an American record producer from Detroit, Michigan, United States. Gosselin's journey in the music industry began at a young age. At just five years old, Gosselin had already mastered his mother's RCA Victor 45 record player. However, it was when he turned 15 that he transitioned from playing music on his turntable to creating it himself. With his Technics SL-1200 turntables, Gosselin developed his own unique turntable disciplines inspired by drum rudiments, ultimately transforming the turntables into an instrument.
During his senior year of high school, Gosselin enrolled part-time at the Recording Institute of Detroit (RID). After graduating from high school, he pursued full-time education at RID, where he obtained his record engineering certification two years later. In 1999, an RID professor recommended Gosselin for an internship with Barrett Strong and Robert Bateman, prominent figures in the Motown Sound, known for their hit songs like Marvin Gaye's "I Heard It Through The Grapevine" and the Marvelettes' "Please Mr. Postman."
During his internship, Gosselin's responsibilities varied widely. He handled tasks such as electrically wiring rooms and converting them into functional studios, synchronizing MP keyboards, editing and recording with pro-tools, and mixing tracks. He gained recognition for his talent, with Barrett Strong simply telling him, "Work your magic!"
By 2000, Gosselin was managing two studios: his own studio called Asylum and another associated with a local street hustler who worked with many  artists from Detroit. During this time, Gosselin served as an engineer for various musicians, including Proof, Obie Trice (D-12), Slum Village, MC Breed, Juvenile, and Bizzy Bone. He also created radio-promo drops that were broadcast on Detroit's 105.9 WJLB. In 2001, Gosselin became a prominent figure in the local Detroit Hip-Hop scene, regularly producing mixtapes for Green Lantern, D-12, and DJ House Shoes. He also programmed show sets for Eminem and D-12, and was even chosen by Proof to run his label, Iron Fist, alongside Ty Manica, a Detroit-based concert promoter and owner of Merc Records. Later that year, Gosselin was selected as a DJ by Motown Records for a radio tour featuring their R&B artist Dina Rae.
During the tour, Gosselin visited Los Angeles, where he crossed paths with writer/producer Phillip "Whitey" White. Recognizing their combined talents, they decided to join forces and establish Whiteleaf Productions. Immediately, they began working together at the prestigious Enterprise Studios. Through a production deal they secured with Damon Elliot, a songwriter/producer for artists such as Kelly Rowland, Mya, Jessica Simpson, and Beyoncé Knowles, they wrote and produced tracks for movies like "Shark Tale," "1st Daughter," and "Fat Albert."
Gosselin's  abilities as a producer and engineer have led him to collaborate with notable artists including India Arie, Macy Gray, Young Jeezy, Keyshia Cole, Nicole Scherzinger (lead singer of the Pussycat Dolls), Floetry, Cheri Dennis, Game, Proof, Obie Trice, and Corinne Bailey Rae, among others. He also contributed to the soundtrack of the film "De Ja Vu" starring Denzel Washington and received a Grammy nomination in 2006 for his work on India Arie's album "Testimony: Vol.1, Life & Relationships."
