== Early life ==
Gordon attended Archbishop Mitty High School in San Jose, California as a four-year varsity letterwinner and three-time All-West Catholic Athletic League first team selection who led the Monarchs to three West Catholic Athletic League championships. During his senior year, Gordon notched 17.5 points per game and 10.5 rebounds per game in eleven games before being sidelined by an ankle injury. However, that injury had minimal impact on his season and the recognition accrued therein as he was not only invited to play in the 2008 Jordan Brand Classic, but was also named a 2008 member of Long Beach Press-Telegram's Best in the West first team as well as the 2007–08 Les Schwab Invitational most valuable player. In his junior campaign, Gordon registered 15.1 points per game, 10.4 rebound per game, 2.4 assists per game, 2.3 steals per game and 4.1 blocks per game, as he shot 63.8% from the floor, 50.0% from three-point range and 70.2% from the line and led 26–9 Archbishop Mitty to number 9 in USA Today's polls for the West Regional. Again, Gordon racked up honors, being named both 2007 San Jose Mercury News Player of the Year  as well as the 2007 Cal-Hi Sports Athlete of the Year. In addition, Gordon was also named second-team EA Sports 2007 All-American, and a 2007 All-California State first-team selection. As a sophomore in 2005–06, Gordon averaged 14.7 points per game, 10.1 rebound per game, 1.7 assists per game, 2.4 steals per game and 3.9 blocks per game as he was named the 2006 Cal State Sophomore Player of the Year, All-California Interscholastic Federation third team, All-Northern California first team, All-Central Coast Section first team and All-WCAL first team selection. During his freshman year in 2004–05, Gordon posted 9.5 points per game, 9.2 rebound per game, 1.0 assists per game, 3.0 steals per game and 4.5 blocks per game and earned CIF Central Coast Section Freshman of the Year honors, All-WCAL first-team selection and All-CCS second-team honoree.


== College career ==


=== UCLA ===
On May 7, 2007, Drew Gordon committed to play for Ben Howland at UCLA, choosing the Bruins over North Carolina, Duke, Arizona, Washington, Stanford, and California. Gordon was a highly touted recruit, and was reported as a four-star recruit, ranked 15th among all power forwards by both Scout.com and by Rivals.com. He was also scored a 96 (out of 100) recruit by ESPN, who remarked that Gordon "should see some time coming off the bench" in their November 2007 official scouting report.


==== Freshman (2008–2009) ====

Gordon played in 34 of 35 games, only missing the Bruins' first-round game in the NCAA tournament against VCU with a concussion. He picked up his first career double-double with season-highs of 14 points and 11 rebounds in a home win over Wyoming. Gordon averaged 3.6 points per game in an average of 10.9 minutes off the bench while finishing third on the team in offensive rebounds with 45, second in dunks with 19 and third in blocks with 15. He also was the most efficient Bruin that season as he made a team-high 56.5% of his shots (52-for-92) throughout the year.


==== Sophomore (2009–2010) ====

Continuing from his relatively successful freshman season, Gordon played in and started six games for the Bruins, averaging 11.2 points per game and 5.3 rebounds per game. He was able to post 19 points and 6 rebounds in 21 minutes against CSU Bakersfield in a 75–64 UCLA victory, and 18 points and 9 boards in a 71–52 victory over Pepperdine. However, in the midst of a five-game losing streak, Gordon left UCLA's basketball team to transfer, in what was stated to be a "mutual parting". While some news sources speculated Gordon's "increasingly tense" relationship with Bruins' head coach Howland was the deciding factor in Gordon's decision to transfer—especially in light of Howland's decision to suspend Gordon from practice for two days due to Gordon's predilection to be "opinionated and emotional" and to "flash... his temper during games"—it was mostly reported that "it's what's best for all parties" as Gordon did not fit in Howland's preferred style of play.


=== New Mexico ===


==== Junior (2010–2011) ====

After parting ways with UCLA, Gordon quickly enrolled at the University of New Mexico, choosing the Lobos over Notre Dame, San Diego State and UNLV. Gordon noted that "[t]he type of basketball New Mexico plays, on both offense and defense, is the kind of style I excel in, and coach Alford is a great coach with a great reputation". While waiting to become eligible on December 19, 2010, Gordon was noted as leading a group of "impact transfers" who made the Lobos the "biggest, most athletic team" in Alford's tenure. While Gordon did have to sit out the first nine games of New Mexico's 2010–11 campaign due to NCAA transfer rules, he eventually began playing, and started the last 19 the Lobos played, notching 13.0 points per game to go along with 10.5 rebounds per game. He led the Lobos in rebounding 21 games and scored in double digits 22 times (including a streak of 12 from January 12 to February 23). Gordon posted a number of outstanding performances, including: 23 points and 13 rebounds in an 87–77 loss to #6 San Diego State; 16 points and 18 boards in a 68–57 win over Wyoming; and 17 points and 23 rebounds (including 9 offensive) in a 62–60 loss to Utah. Gordon was twice named Mountain West Conference Player of the Week: first, he was named co-player on January 31 after 27 points and 23 rebounds in wins over TCU and No. 9 BYU, and second after 28 points and 26 boards following victories at No. 3 BYU and against Air Force. On March 7, 2011, Gordon was selected as the Mountain West Conference Newcomer of the Year as well as being named Second-Team All-Mountain West.


==== Senior (2011–2012) ====

Gordon was considered to be a potential NBA draft pick, and was even ranked the 26th best NBA prospect by DraftExpress.com, projecting him to be selected in the late first round. On October 3, 2011, Gordon was named to the Wooden Preseason Top 50 as the only player from the Mountain West. Bleacher Report expanded on this selection and tabbed Gordon to be a dark horse candidate for Naismith College Player of the Year award. On October 12, Gordon was selected to both the 2011–12 Mountain West Preseason All-Conference Team and as the Preseason Player of the Year. As the regular season started to roll around, another pair of preseason accolades were given to Gordon: Rivals.com ranked him as the tenth best power forward in the nation (and the highest power forward ranked from a mid-major conference), and Ballin' is a Habit named Gordon as the ninth best center in the nation. On November 4, Gordon was named one of thirty finalists for the Lowe's Senior CLASS Award, an honor given to a Division I senior who displays excellence in the areas of community, classroom, character and competition.Gordon opened his senior season producing double-doubles with consistency, posting eight double-digit points and rebound performances in the first fourteen games. His best non-conference games were wins versus Oklahoma State, where he notched 13 points and 20 rebounds versus the Cowboys in the All-College Classic, a performance which garnered him acknowledgement as the Mountain West Player of the Week, and New Mexico State, where he posted 23 points and 19 boards, another performance in a win over Saint Louis, which garnered Gordon another Mountain West Player of the Week, the fourth of his career.
