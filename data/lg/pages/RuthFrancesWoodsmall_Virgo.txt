== Influence on other authors ==
Woodsmall's work has been cited as source material by other authors, such as Samuel Hugh Moffett in A History of Christianity in Asia, and Laura E. Donaldson in Postcolonialism, Feminism and Religious Discourse.  In American Christians and Islam, Thomas S. Kidd quoted Woodsmall's Muslem Women Enter a New World, in which she attributed the oppressed condition of Islamic women to a "spirit of fatalism". He also noted her hope that education would "bring religion in accord with modern needs."Her work continued to be published after her death, with reprints of Moslem Women Enter A New World in 1975 and 2010, and Women in the changing Islamic system in 1983.
