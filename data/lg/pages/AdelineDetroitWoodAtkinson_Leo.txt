Adeline Detroit Wood was born on July 30, 1841, to Sarah Ann (née White) and William Wood in Bedford County, Virginia.

Together, they had six children, three sons and three daughters.She was known professionally as "A.D. Atkinson".


== Career ==

In the mid-1870's, Atkinson's husband's income as a bricklayer was insufficient to support their growing family, so she took on boarders. By 1881, her business was doing so well that she opened the Warwick House hotel on Main Street in Lynchburg. The Warwick House was a Confederate hospital during the war.As her husband's health declined, they moved to Richmond. In 1884, she took over the struggling Saint James Hotel. By 1889, she became the proprietor of the American Hotel, which she renamed the Lexington in 1894. On April 25, 1903, Atkinson sold the Lexington to A. G. Spratley and J. L. Rodwell.As she was selling the Lexington, she purchased the Saint Clair Hotel, at the corner of Ninth and Grace Street in Richmond. She destroyed it and in its place built the Hotel Richmond with a 140-room capacity. Hotel Richmond opened on April 4, 1904, and was successful, competing with the popular Jefferson Hotel. The hotel did so well that in 1912, Atkinson doubled its capacity and its value was estimated to be almost $1 million.She brought her sons in to help manage Hotel Richmond, but remained in charge until her health declined in 1916.
