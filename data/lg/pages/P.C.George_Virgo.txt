He was elected to the Niyamasabha in 1981, 1982, 1996, 2001 and 2006, all from Poonjar constituency.He was the incumbent MLA from Poonjar constituency in Kottayam District of Kerala until 2021. George was also vice-chairman of Kerala Congress (M), a splinter faction of Kerala Congress. The splinter groups of Kerala Congress are known for frequent splits and mergers. PC George was formerly a leader of the Kerala Congress (J) party and was critical of K.M. Mani, the leader of Kerala Congress (M). Later PC George quit the Joseph group and formed his own group and named it "Kerala Congress (secular)". Recently, PC George merged his group with K.M Mani's faction. Before joining Kerala Congress (M) his party was affiliated with the LDF.
P.C. George served as the Chief Whip, Government of Kerala in the UDF Government from 2011, until he was removed from the post on 7 April 2015. This removal was triggered based on the fights within the Kerala Congress (M), spurred due to the bar scam allegations on K M Mani.
After these dramatic incidents, PC George made a huge comeback in the 2016 panchayat elections and was looking forward to the upcoming Assembly election.
Just before the election, PC George was removed from "Kerala Congress (M)" party. And hence he decides to face the election without the support of any parties and to compete in the election as independent candidate. It was a fight unlike anything seen in this elections in the district: One man against the three major political formations. In the end, P.C. George came out victorious in style with a thumping margin of 27,821 votes. Mr. George was ousted from both the LDF and the UDF and even dubbed as the man leaders loved to hate. He was a marked man by CPI(M) leader Pinarayi Vijayan and hated by K.M. Mani, P.J. Joseph, and even Oommen Chandy. Though he expected the Left to take him back, it was not to be so. In fact, during the protracted campaign period, Mr. Vijayan had personally visited Poonjar twice to ensure that Mr. George was defeated. However, it appears that his major success was in operating a major split in the local unit of the CPI(M) and the UDF. In 2011, the LDF Independent Mohan Thomas received 44,105 votes. This time, LDF candidate P.C. Joseph could only muster just half the votes at 22,270 votes. Mr. George, in fact, raised his vote share from 59,809 in 2011 to 63,621. The UDF share came down to 35,800.On 10 April 2019, Kerala Janapaksham, led by PC George joined the NDA.
