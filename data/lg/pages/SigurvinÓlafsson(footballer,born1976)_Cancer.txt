He made the bench several times during the 1993 season, but did not make any further first-team appearances. The following year, Sigurvin joined German Oberliga side VfB Stuttgart II. He did not play any matches during his first season with the club, but made 55 appearances over the next two campaigns, scoring 11 goals during that time.

In April 1999, Sigurvin joined Reykjavík-based club Fram. He made his debut on 22 July 1999, scoring his team's goal in the 1–3 defeat to Grindavík. During his two seasons with Fram, he made a total of 27 league appearances and scored 6 goals. In March 2000, he had a trial with English club Stoke City, but no offer of a permanent deal was made. On 24 November 2000, Sigurvin was signed by league champions KR. He played his first match for the club in the opening fixture of the 2001 campaign, a 0–1 defeat away at Fylkir. The team started the season disappointingly, losing three of their first four games. Sigurvin netted his first goal for KR in the 2–4 loss to Valur on 25 June 2001, and went on to score twice more during the season as the team ended the campaign in seventh place. During the 2002 season, he scored seven goals in 12 league matches as KR were crowned Úrvalsdeild champions. He went on to score twice in 10 appearances the following campaign as the team successfully defended their league title. Sigurvin spent a total of five seasons with KR, during which time he played 75 first-team games and scored 21 goals. It was announced in October 2005 that he would not be offered a new contract by the club, and that six other clubs were interested in signing him.Sigurvin signed for Icelandic champions FH in October 2005. On 30 July 2006 he netted the winning goal in a 1–0 away win over ÍA which put the team 12 points clear at the top of the table. He played 14 matches in total during the 2006 season, helping the side to their third consecutive Úrvalsdeild championship. He made nine appearances the following campaign, scoring twice. Sigurvin was offered a new contract by FH at the end of the 2007 season but he rejected it, announcing that he was considering retiring from football in order to spend more time with his family and concentrate on his career as a lawyer. He confirmed on 9 May 2008 that he would not play football during the 2008 season after failing to find his form over the winter break. Nevertheless, the following week he joined newly promoted 2. deild club Grótta.Sigurvin played only five matches during his first season with Grótta as the club secured their 2. deild status with a seventh-place finish. He became an integral part of the team the following campaign, however, scoring 12 goals in 18 league matches as the side won the division and promotion to the 1. deild. His form during the 2009 campaign led to him being named the 2. deild Player of the Year and he was one of three Grótta players selected in the Team of the Year, along with fellow former Iceland international Kristján Finnbogason. Sigurvin revealed he had enjoyed playing in a lower division more than playing top-tier football due to the relaxed nature of the league. However, while stating his intention to train with Grótta the following season, he would not commit to extending his playing career. He remained contracted to the club for the following two seasons, but played just nine more first-team matches. Sigurvin made his final league appearance for Grótta on 2 June 2011, coming on as a substitute for Andri Björn Sigurðsson in the 1–0 win against BÍ/Bolungarvík.

He made his debut for SR in the 2–4 defeat to ÍH on 5 June 2012. Sigurvin played five league matches for SR during a two-month loan spell, scoring on his final appearance in the 2–7 home defeat to ÍH on 19 July 2012.
