== NFL career ==
After being drafted by the Jaguars, he was a starter for their inaugural season. Demarco played four seasons for the Jaguars. He signed a 3-year deal with the Cincinnati Bengals in 1999, but he retired after that season due to injuries.


== Post NFL ==
DeMarco's post-NFL plight was featured in a Men's Journal article entitled "Casualties of the NFL."  It detailed devastating spinal damage DeMarco received while playing in the NFL, and continued playing with for sometime after. The piece received widespread praise from advocates who sought medical and financial help for disabled NFL retirees. Like most NFL players DeMarco took painkillers to mask the pain so he could continue playing causing further damage to his body.
