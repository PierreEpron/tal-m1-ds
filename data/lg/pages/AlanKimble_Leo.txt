== Playing career ==


=== Charlton Athletic ===
Left back Kimble started his career at Charlton Athletic alongside his twin brother, Garry Kimble. They both progressed through the youth ranks to make brief appearances in the Charlton first team before the pair of them joined Exeter City on loan and then Cambridge United on free transfers in July 1986.


=== Cambridge United ===
Alan Kimble went on to play 299 games for United, scoring 24 goals, most of which came from the penalty spot. He played a pivotal part in the club's amazing success in climbing the lower leagues in the early 1990s but left following relegation from (old) Division Two in 1993 after seven years with the club.


=== Wimbledon ===
Kimble moved to Premier League side Wimbledon for a fee of £175,000 and stayed there for nine years, and was a regular first team player, making 215 league appearances. While in the Wimbledon side, Kimble was known to get to the byline and lump the ball upfield to the strikers. He failed to score a league goal for the club but did net once for them against Huddersfield Town in one of his 25 League Cup games for the club. Wimbledon finished in the top ten of the Premier League three times, and were League Cup semi finalists twice and FA Cup semi finalists once while Kimble played for them, but went down from the Premier League in 2000. He finally left at the end of the 2001-02 season, around the same time that the club's controversial move to Milton Keynes - which eventually resulted in its rebranding as Milton Keynes Dons - was announced.
