Eaves is a professor generics of genetics at the University of British Columbia and is also the co-founder with Allen C Eaves of Terry Fox Laboratory (Vancouver, Canada).


== Education and career ==
In high school, Eaves was interested in becoming a physician but later decided to pursue into research due to gender discrimination in medical school acceptance rates.Eaves received a BA in Biology and Chemistry and in 1964 and 1966 an MSc in Biology (Genetics) working on oncogenic viruses from Queen's University. She then pursued doctoral training at the Paterson Laboratories of the Christie Hospital and Holt Radium Institute and obtained a PhD from the University of Manchester in Great Britain in 1969.
She did postdoctoral work on hematopoiesis at the Ontario Cancer Institute in Toronto, Canada, as a member of the research team of James Till and Ernest McCulloch.
After completing her studies, moved to British Columbia because she was offered an academic position at the University of British Columbia.Her contributions to the professional and scholarly community include acting as the editor-in-chief of the journal Experimental Hematology, in addition to serving as the president of the National Cancer Institute (Canada), the associate scientific director of the Canadian Stem Cell Network, and president of the International Society of Experimental Hematology.
