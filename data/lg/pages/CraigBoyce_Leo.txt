== Career ==


=== Australia ===
Craig Boyce started riding at the now defunct Liverpool Speedway in western Sydney during the mid-1980s and established himself as one of not only the most promising young riders from New South Wales, but in Australia, finishing third in the 1988 Australian Under-21 Championship. He won his first NSW State Championship at the Newcastle Motordrome with a 15-point maximum from defending champion and World #3 Todd Wiltshire on 26 December 1990, before going on to win the 1991 Australian Championship at the Arunga Park Speedway in Alice Springs, again with a 15-point maximum, defeating two-time defending champion Glenn Doyle of Western Australia. Boyce inflicted Doyle's only defeat of the night when the pair clashed in Heat 18 with each going into the race unbeaten. Boyce beat Doyle out of the gate and was never headed to win his first national championship while Dolye had to be content with second in both the race and on the night.
As reigning Australian Champion, Boyce was seeded to the 1992 Australian Championship at North Arm in Adelaide after he finished in third place in the NSW championship (under the old single meeting format, only the top two from each state or territories title were automatic qualifiers for the Australian Championship). However, his lackluster form continued in Adelaide when he could only manage 8th place in defense of his Australian title, scoring 8 points with only one win on the night.
Boyce would win the NSW title another three times during his career (1993, 1994 and 1995) while also winning the Australian Championship twice more, in 1996 at the Motordrome, and 1997 at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground.
In 1996, Craig Boyce won the 10 round Australian Speedway Masters Series (also known as the "Series 500"), easily winning the series from Sam Ermolenko and defending champion Tony Rickardsson. He would finish second in the Masters Series to Leigh Adams in 1997.
