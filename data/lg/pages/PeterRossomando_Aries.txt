=== Early years ===
Rossomando began his coaching career at the University of New Haven under new head coach Tony Sparano, who had been offensive coordinator at Boston during Rossomando's playing career. Both men spent five years at New Haven and developed a close relationship. Sparano resigned in February 1999 to join the staff of the "new" Cleveland Browns; a month later, Rossomando left to become offensive line coach at Northeastern University under long-time head coach Barry Gallup.Gallup resigned from Northeastern in May 2000 to become an assistant athletic director at Boston College. New head coach Don Brown did not retain Rossomando, who joined the staff at the State University of New York College at Cortland under head coach Dan MacNeill, then just a few years into a twenty-two year tenure. After one season at Cortland, the University of Albany hired Rossomando as its offensive line coach. Rossomando spent the next seven seasons at Albany as part of Bob Ford's staff. In 2005, he was promoted to offensive coordinator and associate head coach.New Haven, where Rossomando had coached from 1994–1998 with Tony Sparano, had discontinued football after the 2003 season. The school resumed the program at the end of 2007 and hired Rossomando as its new head coach. It was Rossomando's first head coaching job. The nascent team played four scrimmages in 2008 while Rossomando and the New Haven athletic staff rebuilt the program. The team began competing as a member of the Northeast-10 Conference in 2009. In five years at New Haven, Rossomando's teams won the conference three times and posted an overall record of 42–13. He was awarded the Liberty Mutual Coach of the Year Award for NCAA Division II for the 2012 season. 


=== Central Connecticut State ===
After the 2013 season, Central Connecticut State University hired Rossomando as their head coach, replacing Jeff McInerney.During his tenure at CCSU, Rossomando compiled a record of 23–34. The 2017 team won the Northeast Conference and appeared in the FCS playoffs, the first such appearance for CCSU.

Rossomando resigned following the 2018 season to become the offensive line coach at Rutgers under Chris Ash. Rossomando succeeded A. J. Blazek, who had resigned to take the same job at North Dakota State. Rutgers fired Ash midway through the 2019 season; Rossomando departed at the end of the season to become the offensive line coach at Vanderbilt.Rossomando's hiring was part of a larger reshuffling of assistants at Vanderbilt under seventh-year head coach Derek Mason that included new offensive coordinator Todd Fitch and new defensive coordinator Ted Roof. Vanderbilt fired Mason at the tail end of a COVID-19-shortened season in which the team ultimately went 0–9. New head coach Clark Lea did not retain Rossomando, and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte hired Rossomando as its offensive line coach on March 3, 2021.


=== Charlotte ===
Charlotte head coach Will Healy was heading into his third season. Offensive line coach Lee Grimes had departed after the 2020 season to take the same position at Kansas under Les Miles.

Amid injuries, the quality of line play improved during 2021 as Charlotte managed a 5–7 record.


==== Interim head coaching ====
Charlotte fired Healy on October 23, 2022, after a 1–7 start, and Rossomando took over as interim head coach. As the interim head coach, he lead the 49ers to two wins and two losses including a 56–23 over bowl eligible Rice.
