Andrea Bonomi (Italian pronunciation: [anˈdrɛːa boˈnɔːmi]; 14 February 1923 – 26 November 2003)  was an Italian footballer who played as a defender.


== Early life ==
Born in Cassano d'Adda, Italy, when Bonomi was six years old, he fell in Adda River and was about to drown when a 10-year-old boy rescued him. Ironically, his rescuer was Valentino Mazzola, who went on to become one of the greatest Italian football players of all time, captaining the Grande Torino team of the 1940s, which would be killed in the Superga air disaster.


== Club career ==
Bonomi was initially nicknamed Ciapin during his early career. He played for several Italian football clubs, but spent most of his career with A.C. Milan. He served as Milan's captain during the 1950–51 season, which ended with a Serie A triumph for the rossoneri, led by the Gre-No-Li attacking trio.


== International career ==
Bonomi played for the Italy national football team for just one match, in 1951, against Switzerland.


== Style of play ==
A tenacious and dynamic defender, Bonomi usually played as a full-back.
