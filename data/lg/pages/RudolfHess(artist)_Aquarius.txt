Hess visited artist Diego Rivera in Mexico, in order to write about him and learn more about his process and his most recent mural. However Hess wrote a scathing review in The Argus (in 1928) titled, “The Tragedy of Rivera," which criticized Diego Rivera as an artist, and Rivera's mural at Secretaría de Educación Pública in Mexico City.
