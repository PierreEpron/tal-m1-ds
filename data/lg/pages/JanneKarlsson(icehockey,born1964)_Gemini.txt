In the 1982–83 season, Karlsson was given the chance to play in Modo Hockey of the Elitserien, Sweden's top ice hockey league. During his first two seasons with the team he did not manage to score any goals, and in the 1983–84 season the team was relegated to Division 1. However, Karlsson and Modo were quickly promoted back to Elitserien the following season.
After the 1985–86 season Karlsson left Modo to play in VIK Västerås HK, who at that time played in the Division 1.
