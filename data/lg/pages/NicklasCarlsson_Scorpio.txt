In 2003, he left for Danish Superliga side AGF. He became a regular there until the winter of 2004/2005 when he told his adviser he wanted to leave. His stated desire was to play for his father's old team and in March 2005 he signed a three-year contract.
He quickly became a regular for the relegated 10-times Swedish champions as a central defender. But he also became joint second top scorer in the team for the 2005 season by scoring seven goals. Many came through set-pieces with Carlsson's ability to score with his head proving a deciding factor.
