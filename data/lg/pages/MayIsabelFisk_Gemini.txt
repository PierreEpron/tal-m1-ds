May Isabel Fisk (born Taylor, later Campbell-Johnston; May 22, 1872 – 1955) was an American monologist and writer. Known for her humor in her writing as well as performance, she was a contemporary and friend of Mark Twain, who called her "the only woman humorist in America". She lived in Britain for some years circa 1922 but returned to the United States in 1938.


== Early life and education ==
May Isabel Taylor was born on May 22, 1872, in New York City, to Isabelle (Gray) and William Willard Taylor. She attended the Sylvanus Reed school in New York and studied voice with a teacher named Toriani in Paris.


== Career ==
Fisk wrote "six books of comic monologues, two books of fiction, several plays, and numerous short stories". Her monologues generally concerned "society women" who did not treat those around them with respect. She wrote at least 60. Some were written in dialect. In addition to her written work, Fisk also performed on the vaudeville stage.Critic Maggie B. Gale, comparing Fisk to Beatrice Herford, argues that both adopted an "anthropological perspective" on "social types" of the time.  Julia Hans argues that "Fisk expresses women's discontent through a mask of humor at a time when popular writers idealized feminine felicity and passivity".According to Mark Twain, a friend of hers, Fisk was the "only woman humorist in America". She said she began writing humor because she didn't want to laugh alone. Fisk said, "Women are so funny because they take trivial things so seriously and because they are so unconsciously humorous".
