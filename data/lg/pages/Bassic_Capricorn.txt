=== 1991–1999: Early career ===
During his early years Bassic composed a flurry of songs, mostly using borrowed equipment. No music was published until after 1999, and many of these old recordings from this period were lost.


=== 1999–2002: MP3.com years ===
He originally uploaded his tracks to MP3.com in the 1990s as a storage solution while moving from Sweden to the USA. Soon after, he was noticed by electronica lovers and gained a large following on MP3.com. By the time the service had been taken over by CNET, his tracks had been downloaded over 7 million times.

During this period Lindhe mainly focused on his family and only released a collection of his most popular songs, with some new material, Daydreamer from his own private website.

After noticing Lindhe's success at MP3.com, Digital Musicworks International persuaded Lindhe to join their roster.  After signing with DMI, Lindhe composed and released Brighter Than the Sun, one of his most appreciated and best-selling releases to date.  In 2007, Lindhe left DMI claiming they had failed to fulfill their contract with him.
