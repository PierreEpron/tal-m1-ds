== Biography ==
Thorvald Kristian Kristensen was born on 7 March 1877 in Fangel, a village 12 km south-west of Odense on the Danish island of Funen. He had his debut on 23 May 1895 in Slagelse. Like his brother, Peter, he changed his name to Ellegård after the farm where they were born. He completed a mason's apprenticeship in 1896.
In 1898 he became professional as the first Danish racing cyclist from the provinces. By 1899, the international community had become aware of his talent and started speculating that he could become the next big star. In 1901 he won both the world championship in sprint and the prestigious Grand Prix de la Ville de Paris. Over the following decade, Ellegård remained the world's leading racing cyclist.
From 1912 Ellegård took up permanent residence with his family in Paris so that his daughter, France Ellegård, could complete her training as a pianist. He participated in his last race on 26 September 1926 at the age of 49. He died on 27 April 1954 and is interred at Søllerød cemetery.
