=== 2019 tragedy ===
In February 2019, a fire took place in Flamengo's youth apartments. 8 boys, aged 14 to 16, died trying to leave the place where they were sleeping. These young boys were part of Flamengo's youth team and were sleeping in Flamengo's property. After general public commotion, Mr Landim, as president of Flamengo, became famous in Brazil for not providing assistance to the families of these boys. In addition, he conducted an aggressive negotiation tactic to pay as little as possible for these families, denying the amount proposed by federal authorities, beginning an extensive legal battle and, then, settling with the families individually after more than 2 years after the accident occurred. Important to note that these families were all of low income and could not afford the legal battle that Mr Landim decided to do.
