Thomas Hugh Collins (4 March 1895 â€“ 19 May 1964) was an English cricketer. 
Collins was born at Nottingham in March 1895. Collins made his debut in first-class cricket for Nottinghamshire against Leicestershire in the 1921 County Championship at Trent Bridge. In this match, he took the wicket of John King with his first delivery in first-class cricket. Following this match, he made a second appearance against Surrey in the County Championship. A gap of fourteen seasons would separate Collins from his next first-class appearances, when he appeared twice for Hampshire in the 1935 County Championship, against Derbyshire and Lancashire. Described by F. S. Ashley-Cooper as a "very promising left-arm fast-medium bowler with a splendid delivery" (though he also bowled slow left-arm orthodox), Collins took 4 wickets at an average of 20.00, with best figures of 1 for 17. He died in May 1964 at Edwalton, Nottinghamshire.
