== Criticism of Wikipedia and disputes ==
Bardakçı's view of history and arguments in his columns and programs lead to some disputes in Turkish media. Besides this, he is critical of the accuracy of Wikipedia. Giving the example of his own biography on Wikipedia having falsely put forward that he had four children, and emphasizing the negative implications of such an accessible source upon students' academic performance in the form of plagiarism, he declared that  the Turkish version of Wikipedia should be banned in Turkey.On the other hand, although he emphasises that he is not a historian, his works mainly contain historical documents and its interpretations and yet he can be qualified as being close to the English school of history writing in the context of historical method or historiography but this side of his works usually finds no reference in his books.
