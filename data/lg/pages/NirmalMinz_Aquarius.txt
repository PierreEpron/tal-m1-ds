Nirmal Minz is Bishop Emeritus of the Protestant North Western Gossner Evangelical Lutheran Church Society who served as bishop from 1980 through 1996.
As a Scholar, Nirmal Minz is an authority on Tribal and indigenous people and culture.  Minz views tribes as being the indigenous people of India and opines that moves to alienate their landholding will cause destruction to the planet Earth itself.  As for the attitudes of the indigenous peoples, Minz believed that the accommodative nature, communitarian ownership of properties and decision by consensus did not find favour with the colonial British India which even continues to this day with the powers that be.  Professor K. P. Aleaz in A Tribal Theology from a Tribal World - View considers Nirmal Minz along with Renthy Keitzer and Timotheas Hembrom as the Theologians with focus on Tribal cultures and ideologies.
The Gossner College, Ranchi was founded by Nirmal Minz in 1971 where stories abound about its students topping the ranks.
