=== Central Coast Mariners ===
Vukovic has previously played for Bonnyrigg White Eagles and Parramatta Power.
Vukovic made his A-League debut for the Central Coast Mariners in September 2005 against Melbourne Victory after the team's first-choice keeper John Crawley suffered a season-ending hip injury. They lost the game 2–1, however Vukovic saved an Archie Thompson penalty and was widely praised for his debut effort. He went on to play 19 more games for the Mariners in the 2005–06 season, achieving five clean sheets, and also saved a penalty from Sydney FC's star player, Dwight Yorke.
Like many Mariners players, Vukovic spends time in schools and at local junior football games, encouraging football at a grassroots level. It was known that Vukovic had desires to play overseas, and it was revealed on 29 June he has signed with TFF First League club Konyaspor.During the third A-League Grand Final on 24 February 2008, Vukovic received a red card for slapping referee Mark Shield's hand following an alleged handball by Newcastle Jets player James Holland. On the day after the Grand Final, Football Federation Australia (FFA) gave Vukovic a 15-month ban (with 6 months suspended), meaning he would not be able to play in the A-League until 24 November 2008.
On 4 March 2008, this ban was reduced on appeal to 12 months (with 3 months suspended), meaning that if Vukovic re-offended in the following year, the 3-month suspended sentence would be activated. The ban extended to national team duty, which precluded him from competing in the 2008 Summer Olympics with the Australian U-23 team, the Olyroos, which he represented in all Olympic qualifiers for Beijing and had captained on occasion.
Vukovic's ban was appealed a second time and on 22 April 2008 Football Federation Australia announced that the appeals committee had settled on a split suspension; up to 24 June 2008 and then from 29 August through to 5 October 2008. Vukovic was also fined $10,000 and will have a further part of his sentence suspended from 6 October 2008 through to 25 January 2009.
Although Vukovic will be ineligible to play for the Mariners in the early rounds of the 2008–09 A-League season, the decision means he will be eligible for selection for the Australian Olympic team competing in Beijing.But in June, FIFA re-stated that his ban from International Competition did include a ban on competing in the Olympic Games with the Olyroos. He is banned from International football till 6 October, when the ban is suspended till 25 January 2009 subject to no further infringement up to, and including, 25 January 2009.Vukovic's 9 month ban remains the longest suspension in A-League history.
