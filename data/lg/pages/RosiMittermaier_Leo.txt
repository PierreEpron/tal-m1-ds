Rosa Anna Katharina Mittermaier-Neureuther (German: [ˈʁozi ˈmɪtɐˌmaɪ̯ɐ] (listen); 5 August 1950 – 4 January 2023) was a German alpine skier. She was the overall World Cup champion in 1976 and a double gold medalist at the 1976 Winter Olympics.Mittermaier competed in alpine skiing from 1967 to 1976, retiring after a highly successful season in which she finished with two Olympic gold medals and ranked first in the World Cup. She remained popular, advertising for sports and as a non-fiction writer. She was known as Gold-Rosi, and she was inducted into Germany's Sports Hall of Fame in April 2006 when it was initiated.


== Life and career ==
Mittermaier was born in Munich and grew up in Reit im Winkl on the Winklmoos-Alm. Her father had run there the Passauer Hütte. A certified skiing instructor, he also owned a skiing school from 1966, and was the first to train his daughters.


=== Racing career ===
Mittermaier made her World Cup debut in the inaugural season of 1967, and won her first World Cup race two seasons later.She won two gold medals (downhill and slalom) and one silver (giant slalom) at the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck. Her victory in the Olympic downhill was the only downhill win in her international career. Mittermaier was the most successful athlete at those games, along with cross-country skier Raisa Smetanina of the Soviet Union, earning her the nickname of Gold-Rosi within Germany (then West Germany).In addition to the overall World Cup title, she also won the season title in slalom and combined in 1976. After winning both races at Copper Mountain in Colorado to wrap up the overall and slalom titles, the four-year-old resort immediately named the race course run after her. In addition to her success in international competition, she also won 16 German national titles during her career.On 31 May 1976, she retired from international competition at age 25, following the very successful 1976 season.


=== After racing ===
After her career in sports, Mittermaier joined Mark McCormack's International Management Group as the only German alongside Jean-Claude Killy, Jackie Stewart, and Björn Borg. During her three-year contract, she designed a collection of winter sports clothing and made international appearances for various skiing products. She wrote non-fiction books, often together with her husband. She worked for several charities and occasionally as a commentator for German television for major sporting events. She established a charitable foundation to aid children with rheumatism in 2000.


=== Personal life and death ===
Mittermaier was born with a twin sister who died at birth. Her younger sister Evi Mittermaier also competed as an alpine skier and previously lived in a hotel. Rosi and Evi also recorded two albums of Bavarian folk songs together.

In 1980 she married Christian Neureuther, winner of six World Cup slalom races. They are the parents of Felix Neureuther (b. 1984), a World Cup ski racer for Germany, and a daughter Ameli who works as a fashion designer.Mittermaier died because of cancer in Garmisch-Partenkirchen on 4 January 2023, at the age of 72 years.
