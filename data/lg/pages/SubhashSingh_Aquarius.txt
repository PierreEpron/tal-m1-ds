Singam Subhash Singh (born 1989) is an Indian professional footballer who plays as a winger for indian club Sagolband United.


== Youth career ==
Subhash had to choose between football or weight-lifting as a career option, his father preferred him to follow the latter, but his family backed him to become a footballer after impressive performances in village tournaments as a kid. He would join the Sports Authority of India at Manipur in 2005 at 15 and spend two years honing his skills before playing for ESU, a Manipuri football club.


== Senior career ==


=== Air India ===
It was soon after his first year with his club in Manipur that his cousin Samson Singh recognizing the potential Subhash had, invited him for a trial with Air-India. The striker impressed the Pilots and was soon signed by the club for their senior team. He enjoyed great success in his two-year stint with the Mumbai-based club and even finished as second top scorer amongst Indians in his second season at the I-League club.
