== Biography ==
Swider-Peltz graduated from Wheaton North High School in Wheaton, Illinois, in 2005 and is currently working, amongst her speedskating career, on her bachelor's degree in Communications at Wheaton College. Swider-Peltz's mother, Nancy Sr., competed in four Winter Olympics as a speed skater from the mid-1970s to the late 1980s. In Nancy Sr.'s last Olympics, baby Nancy was one year old. Once Nancy Jr. picked up speedskating at the age of 13, her dream was to participate in the Olympics. She even competed against her mother at the Olympic trials in 2001, the season they overlapped each other before Nancy Sr. became a coach. Nancy Sr. has been Nancy Jr.'s coach throughout her career and now her brother, Jeffrey Peltz Jr. (who goes by Jeffrey Swider-Peltz in the speedskating world), has begun speedskating. Nancy Jr. now coaches at Park Ridge Speed Skating club in Park Ridge, Illinois. She is currently a Brand Partner for Young Living, a company that promotes health and wellness products.
