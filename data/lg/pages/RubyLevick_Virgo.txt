These included a set of panels for the Chapel of St Edmund in Hunstanton plus panels and reredos for St Brelades in Jersey.Levick exhibited her work at the Society of Medallists in 1898 and 1901, with the Arts and Crafts Exhibition Society in 1899, 1903 and 1916 and also at the Walker Art Gallery in  Liverpool, the Ridley Art Club and at the Royal Academy in London.
