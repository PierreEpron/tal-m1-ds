Franklin Augustus Alberger (January 14, 1825 â€“ August 24, 1877) was an American businessman and politician from New York.


== Life ==
He was the son of Job Alberger, a butcher who owned a shop and slaughterhouses. In 1837, the family removed to Buffalo. Franklin learned the butcher's trade from his father, and opened a pork packing business with his brothers. He married Katharine Rice, and they had four children.
He entered politics as a Whig and joined the Republican Party on its foundation. In 1854, he was elected alderman from the Eleventh Ward, and in 1859 from the Ninth Ward. The Union city convention was held on October 22, 1859, and after many ballots Alberger was nominated for Mayor. He was Mayor of Buffalo, New York from January 2, 1860, to January 6, 1862.
He was a Canal Commissioner from 1862 to 1867, elected in 1861 and 1864 on the Union ticket.
He was a Republican member of the New York State Assembly (Erie Co., 3rd D.) in 1871, 1872, 1873 and 1874.
He died suddenly, apparently of cholera, and was buried at the Forest Lawn Cemetery, Buffalo.
