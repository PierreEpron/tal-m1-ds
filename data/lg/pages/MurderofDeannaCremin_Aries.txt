Deanna J. Cremin (March 26, 1978 – March 30, 1995) was a 17-year-old American girl from Somerville, Massachusetts, found sexually assaulted and strangled to death near her home. No charges have ever been filed. The case deeply shocked the local community, and a $70,000 reward is being offered for evidence leading to an arrest and prosecution.


== Biography ==
Cremin was a student of Somerville High School. She did volunteer work at Somerville Cable Access Television, worked with third graders at the Child Development Program at her school, and worked at Star Market.


== Murder ==
On March 29, 1995, Deanna Cremin followed her usual Wednesday routine of going out with friends and visiting her boyfriend.  Her curfew was 10 pm; when she was not home by midnight, her mother tried unsuccessfully to reach her on her pager. Her boyfriend, considered the last person to see Cremin alive, admits walking her home that night, but says he left her halfway, which, according to Deanna's mother, was unusual, as he had always walked her all the way home prior to that night.


== Discovery ==
Cremin's body was found four days after her 17th birthday, at 8 a.m. on March 30, behind a senior housing complex, less than a block from her home. She was found by two children she babysat for who were taking a shortcut on their way to school. Her body was lying on its back, and mostly undressed. She had been strangled and sexually assaulted.An autopsy revealed she had been strangled, and her murder remains unsolved.


== Investigation ==

Police identified three men as persons of interest in the crime: Cremin's teenage boyfriend; a Somerville firefighter more than twice Cremin's age, said to have been fixated on her; and a third adult man, later imprisoned at Massachusetts Correctional Institution – Cedar Junction. But no charges were filed. In 2005, Middlesex district attorney Martha Coakley announced new forensic evidence had been found with procedures unavailable in 1995, raising hope of progress in the case, but again no charges were pressed.In 2009, Middlesex district attorney Gerard Leone stated that the murder would be solved, but law enforcement needed witnesses who had remained silent to come forward. The Cremin family erects a billboard each year since her death, to offer a reward for information about the killer. At the bottom of the billboard, a quote reads: "You know what you did to me. How much longer must I wait! Please help make my time in heaven restful." The reward has grown from $10,000 in 1995 to $20,000 by 2005, to $50,000 in 2014.
