== Life ==


=== Early years ===
Lin Ching-hsuan was born in Kaohsiung to an ordinary peasant family. Being interested in writing, he decided to become a writer since he was only eight years old.

Then, he was employed as a journalist, which provided him a chance to research into and get better understanding of the social status quo. Also, drawing on his experience of interviewing people in social affairs, his own writings were closely related to everyday life and current affairs.  By the age of thirty, he had been awarded almost all the important prizes in the Taiwan literature circle.


=== After thirty years old ===
Lin Ching-hsuan started to learn Buddhism systematically by reading and studying the Buddhist sutras. Besides, he went to stay in a temple to develop his understanding of Buddhism and cultivate his spirituality from the age of thirty-two to thirty-five. In this three years study in the temple, he has obtained a more merciful and peaceful attitude towards life, and he found that his spirituality was sublimated.  Owing to the study of Buddhist thought, he rethought the meaning of life. He wrote all these new understandings in a series of books which were then published under the name Shen Xin An Dun (《身心安頓》). This new series was made the bestseller in the 1990s.  As a middle-age man with a writing career, he completed  his representative work the Bodhi Series (《菩提系列》).  Additionally, his edited a collection of Modern Buddhist Scriptures (《現代佛經系列》 ) which immediately aroused a craze for Buddhist study among the public.

Some female organizations burned his books in order protest against his hypocrisy. Therefore, Lin was under enormous pressure from the public opinions, and he stopped publishing for a long time.Lin's massive success in Taiwan and post-controversy rebirth as a popular author in China "centre him as an innovative figure that managed to navigate the evolving political and cultural situations on both sides of the Taiwan Strait".
