During the first three games of the 1975–76 season, he tallied a combined 51 points and 21 rebounds, including a 22-point, 14 rebound performance in a victory over the Seattle SuperSonics on October 28, 1975.On November 27, 1975, Garrett was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers with Nate Thurmond for Steve Patterson and Eric Fernsten. After playing parts of two seasons with the Cavaliers, Garrett was then traded on January 14, 1977 with two first-round draft choices to the Milwaukee Bucks for Elmore Smith and Gary Brokaw. Garrett struggled to find playing time in Milwaukee, and was waived before the start of the 1977–78 season. His stint with the Bucks proved to be his last in the NBA. Over a five-year NBA career, he averaged 5.1 points per game and 2.3 rebounds per game.Garrett was one of several former players who participated in the Chicago Bulls' 20th and 25th anniversary games in 1985 and 1990.
