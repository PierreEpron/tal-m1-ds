In 2004, Fund wrote Stealing Elections: How Voter Fraud Threatens Our Democracy (ISBN 1-59403-061-8), in which he strongly criticizes the American election system, describing it as "befitting an emerging Third World country rather than the world's leading democracy."

wrote Who's Counting?: How Fraudsters and Bureaucrats Put Your Vote at Risk (ISBN 1-59403-618-7), which argues voter fraud is a significant issue in U.S. elections.
