== Work ==
Drange appropriates selfies from popular influencers and transforms them into classical oil paintings, often on large canvas. As a statement on authorship and originality, Drange doesn't paint any of his artwork. Instead, he creates sketches from various digital found-objects, with a strong preference for self-portrait photographs as source material, and sends them to an oil painting factory in China, where they are painted by hand on large-scale canvas. The amalgamation of selfies, emojies and other depictions of social media symbols are central to all of Drange's works.Drange's work has appeared in several exhibitions and magazines such as the Kunstforum International, Numéro, Weserburg, and the Benaki Museum, as well as the exhibition "Link in Bio" at MDBK Leipzig and the international group show "The artist is online" at Galerie König, curated by Anika Meier and Johann König. He has exhibited with artists such as Thomas Webb, Petra Cortright, Arvida Byström, Chloe Wise, Gretchen Andrew, Daniel Arsham and Jonas Lund. 
He Travelled to Venezuela in early 2013 and documented a socialist society that retains vestiges of capitalism.
