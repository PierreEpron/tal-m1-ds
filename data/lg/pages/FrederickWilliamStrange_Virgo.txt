Frederick William Strange (September 9, 1844 – June 5, 1897) was an English-born physician, surgeon and political figure in Ontario, Canada. He represented York North in the House of Commons of Canada from 1878 to 1882 as a Liberal-Conservative member.
He was the son of Thomas Strange of Berkshire and studied medicine at Liverpool and University College in London. Strange came to Ontario in 1869. A long-time militia medical officer, he served as a deputy surgeon general for the Canadian militia from 1893 to 1896 and was coroner for York County. Strange was an unsuccessful candidate for a seat in the House of Commons in 1896. He died a year later at the age of 52.
The community of Strange was named in his honour after he secured a post office for the community in 1880.
