== Biography ==
Stringer is a native of Edenborn, Pennsylvania, and a member of the Alumni Hall of Fame at her alma mater. One of her first great accomplishments was in high school when she sued her school for not allowing her to be a cheerleader because of her race. She won the case and was given a spot on her school's cheerleading squad, being the first black cheerleader in her town since 1955–1958, when Dolores Dantzler was on the team. She is a graduate of Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania where she was a four-sport athlete, participating in basketball, softball, volleyball, and field hockey. Stringer and her late husband, William D. Stringer, whom she met as a student at Slippery Rock, have three children: David, Janine (Nina), and Justin.

=== Coaching career ===

Stringer arrived at Rutgers in July 1995, after 23 years combined as head coach at Cheyney State and the University of Iowa. She stated in her autobiography that a major reason she took the coaching job at Rutgers was that she felt that her children were not learning enough about their culture or comfortable enough around fellow African Americans, due to the state of Iowa being a majority white populated area. In 1998 her team posted its first 20-win season in four years (22–10), winning the Big East title with a 14–4 regular-season record. In the postseason, the Scarlet Knights advanced to the NCAA Tournament’s Sweet 16 with a 62–61 win against Iowa State. In 2000, her team went to the Final Four.
In 2007, Rutgers again reached the NCAA Tournament's Final Four after upsetting #1 seed Duke. After the 2007 tournament, Stringer served as spokesperson for the Rutgers team during a media firestorm over a derogatory reference to the team made on the radio and television program Imus in the Morning. The Rutgers players eventually accepted an apology from talk-show host Don Imus. In the wake of the controversy, New York senator and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton also met with Stringer.
In early March 2008, Stringer's autobiography, titled Standing Tall: A Memoir of Tragedy and Triumph, was released through Crown Books.
Also, on February 27, 2008, Stringer became the third women's basketball coach to win 800 career games. She led the Scarlet Knights to the Elite Eight in 2008 where they lost to fellow women's basketball powerhouse, the University of Connecticut.
