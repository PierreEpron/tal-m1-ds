He was re-elected in the 1934 and 1936 elections, finishing second each time (of eighteen and sixteen candidates, respectively).
Fry resigned midway through his third two-year term to run for mayor in the 1937 election, challenging incumbent Joseph Clarke.  He defeated Clarke by three thousand votes, and would go on to be re-elected in 1938 (defeating three challengers, including Clarke), 1939 (defeating local member of the Legislative Assembly of Alberta Samuel Barnes), 1940 (defeating two challengers), 1941 (defeating alderman George Campbell), 1942 (by acclamation), 1943 (defeating Thomas Cairns), and 1944 (defeating Rice Sheppard).  He did not seek re-election in the 1945 election, and did not seek political office again thereafter.

He died December 23, 1946, survived by his wife, four daughters, and one son.His eight years as mayor were the longest in Edmonton's history at that point.  William Hawrelak surpassed the record in 1963 (Hawrelak, who served three non-consecutive stints as mayor, would serve a total of more than nine years).
