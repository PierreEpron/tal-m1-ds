== Biography ==
Born in Manatee County, Florida, Blosser was taken by Boston with their first-round pick in the 1989 Major League Baseball draft out of Sarasota High School. His brief trial with the 1993–1994 Red Sox came after he slugged 23 homers for Triple–A Pawtucket in 1992. In his 22-game MLB career, he collected two singles and a double and six bases on balls in 45 plate appearances, hitting .077 and collecting two runs batted in.
Following his minor league career, Blosser played in 34 games for Japan's Seibu Lions in 1999. He later appeared in 208 games for two clubs in the independent Atlantic League. He retired from pro baseball in 2008 with 202 career home runs — 155 in the minors, 44 in the independent leagues, and three in Japan.
Blosser batted and threw left-handed, stood 6 feet 3 inches (1.91 m) tall and weighed 200 pounds (91 kg).
He currently runs a private detective agency and has many investments in real estate in both Florida and Japan.
