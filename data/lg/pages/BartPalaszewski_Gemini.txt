Bart K. Palaszewski (Polish pronunciation: [palaˈʂɛfskʲi]; born May 30, 1983) is a retired Polish-American professional mixed martial artist who most recently competed in the UFC's Featherweight division. A professional competitor from 2002 until 2014, Palaszewski has also formerly competed for the WEC, the Quad Cities Silverbacks of the IFL, and King of the Cage.


== Background ==
Palaszewski was born in Warsaw, Poland and lived there until he was 13 years old when he and his family immigrated to Wonder Lake, Illinois. In Poland, he was a "punching bag" for his older cousin who was involved in kickboxing, and Palaszewski also began judo when he was in the third grade. However, his coach became an Olympian and after Palaszewski was not happy with his old coach's replacement, he trained for six months in Brazilian jiu-jitsu and Muay Thai before being introduced to mixed martial arts. He trained whilst working as a photographer and graphic designer and holding other computer-related jobs. Then, after seeing his first MMA event at a show in McHenry, Illinois, Palaszewski was hooked. Although his official record indicates that he lost his first four professional fights, he claims that he had other wins professionally but only the four losses were documented when his coach sent in the results. Nevertheless, he then bounced back with eight consecutive victories.
