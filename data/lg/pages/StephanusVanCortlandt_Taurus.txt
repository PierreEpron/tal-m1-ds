Stephanus van Cortlandt (May 7, 1643 – November 25, 1700) was the first native-born mayor of New York City, a position which he held from 1677 to 1678 and from 1686 to 1688. He was the patroon of Van Cortlandt Manor and was on the governor's executive council from 1691 to 1700. He was the first resident of Sagtikos Manor in West Bay Shore on Long Island, which was built around 1697. A number of his descendants married English military leaders and Loyalists active in the American Revolution, and their descendants became prominent members of English society.


== Early life ==
Stephanus van Cortlandt was born on May 7, 1643, the son of Captain Olof Stevense van Cortlandt. His father had been born at Wijk bij Duurstede, in the Dutch Republic, and in 1637 arrived in New Amsterdam. Beginning as a soldier and bookkeeper, Olof Stevense van Cortland rose to high office in the colonial service of the Dutch West India Company, serving many terms as burgomaster and alderman before dying in 1684. His mother, nicknamed "Anna", was Annetje (née Loockermans) van Cortlandt (born Turnhout; March 17, 1618), who may have been the person who began the "Santa Claus" tradition in America.His parents had four children: Stephanus van Cortlandt (1643–1700); Jacobus van Cortlandt (1658–1739), who married Eva de Vries Philipse (born 1660); Maria van Cortlandt, who married Jeremias van Rensselaer (1632–1674); and Catherine van Cortlandt, who married firstly Johannes Derval and secondly, after his death, Frederick Philipse (1626–1702), the first lord of Philipsborough Manor. Philipse was previously married to Margaret Hardenbroeck (1637–1691) and during that marriage, had adopted her daughter, Eva de Vries (born 1660), who thus took the name of Philipse.  Eva's father and Margaret's first husband was Peter Rudolphus de Vries (died 1661).


== Career ==
In 1668, he was appointed ensign of one of the militia companies of New York City. In 1677, he was appointed by the English Governor of the Province of New York to a two-year term as mayor of New York City, the first who had been born in America. Although of Dutch parentage, he was reportedly appointed due to his intelligence, and social position in the community. In 1685, he joined partners Francis Rombouts and Jacobus Kip in being awarded what became known as the Rombout Patent to lands along the Hudson River in what is today's southern Dutchess County.During his time in office, van Cortland remained an adherent of the aristocratic Whig party, especially during Leisler's Rebellion from 1689 to 1691. When Delanoy, the Leisler candidate, was elected to the mayoralty, in place of Van Cortland, the latter refused to deliver up the city seal. It has been said that when a committee came to his home, his wife shut the door in their faces.
