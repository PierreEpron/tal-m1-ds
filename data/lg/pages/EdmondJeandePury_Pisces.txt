Another student, Paul Milliet, wrote of the image in his memoirs: "The fragment…shows the athletic torso of…de Pury. Alfred Lenglet's painting is solid and luminous, but to render completely the elegant vigor of the model would have required the chisel of a Greek sculptor."Although he painted landscapes, de Pury's main focus was portraiture.
