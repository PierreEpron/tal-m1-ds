Buck, was the founder of the Buck Company, a fruit-growing company, who had been elected to the California State Senate in 1895. He attended the public schools. He was a member of the Theta Delta Chi fraternity, and graduated from the University of California at Berkeley in 1908 and from the law department of Harvard University in 1911. He was admitted to the bar the same year and commenced practice in San Francisco, California.


=== Business ===
He was involved in business ventures including fruit growing, oil refining, and lumber, partly thanks to his inheritance.In 1900, together with Burton E. Green (1868-1965), Charles A. Canfield (1848-1913), Max Whittier (1867–1928), William F. Herrin (1854-1927), Henry E. Huntington (1850-1927), William G. Kerckhoff (1856–1929), W.S. Porter and Frank H. Balch, known as the Amalgamated Oil Company, he purchased Rancho Rodeo de las Aguas from Henry Hammel and Andrew H. Denker and renamed it Morocco Junction. After drilling for oil and only finding water, they reorganized their business into the Rodeo Land and Water Company to develop a new residential town later known as Beverly Hills, California. Addendum: This purchase could not have been made by 13 year old Frank H. Buck Jr. It must refer to Frank H. Buck Sr, his father.  Frank H. Buck (Sr) married Anna Stevenson in 1886, and their first son, Frank H Buck Jr was born the following year. Frank H. Buck (Sr) was the son of Leonard W Buck (1834-1895) and Anna Bellows Buck.
