Casimir Oberfeld (16 November 1903 – January 1945), also spelled Kazimierz Oberfeld, was a Polish-born French composer. He worked on many film scores and also wrote popular songs of the 1920s and 1930s. Following France's invasion by Germany in 1940 during the Second World War, as a Jew Oberfeld faced increasing persecution. Having taken shelter in Italian-occupied Nice he was arrested when the area was taken over by the Germans. He was sent to Auschwitz where he was murdered in January 1945.

The music of the patriotic song of Nazi-collaborationist Vichy France "Maréchal, nous voilà !", while credited to André Montagnard and Charles Courtioux, was in fact plagiarised from a work by Oberfeld called "La Margoton du bataillon."
