Master Gurbanta Singh (4 August 1904 â€“ 5 February 1980) was an Indian politician, educationist and social reformer from Punjab, India.
He was a former member of the Unionist Party and then Indian National Congress. Master Gurbanta Singh was one of the tallest Dalit leaders of Punjab.


== Early life ==
Master Gurbanta Singh was born in Dhaliwal village, Jullundur, Punjab, in British India. He completed his education at Jalandhar and became a school teacher at Sain Dass A.S Senior Secondary School (Jalandhar).
His political career started when he became village sarpanch. After the influence of the Ad Dharm movement, he declared himself Ad Dharmi in the 1931 census along with other Dalits of Punjab, especially in Doaba.


== Ad-Dharm Movement ==
In the mid-1920s, Gurbanta Singh came into contact with Mangu Ram Mugowalia, a fellow caste man and also a founder member of the Ghadar Party. Mangu Ram had started the Ad-Dharm movement and established many mandals in the Doaba region of Punjab, where Dalits formed a major share of the population. Although in the initial years, Singh's closeness to the movement was because of oppression and illiteracy among Dalits of Punjab, later, he fully got involved in this social movement and became General Secretary of Ad-Dharm Mandal of Jalandhar. Both Mangu Ram and Gurbanta Singh took the Ad-Dharm movement to its zenith, and it became the most successful Dalit reform movement in North India. At the same time, he joined Unionist Party and fought the election unsuccessfully.After years of long contributions to the movement but due to differences with Seth Kishan Dass, another prominent leader of the Ad-Dharm movement, he left the Mandal and became active in politics.
