Samuil Markovich Blekhman (Russian: Самуи́л Ма́ркович Бле́хман; 15 May 1918 – 26 December 1982) was a renowned philatelist of the Soviet Union who wrote a number of notable philatelic books and articles. He was born in Moscow, was trained and worked as an engineer, and lived much of his life in Moscow.
Blekhman's works were related to postal history and postage stamps of Tuva, Mongolia, Russia and Soviet Union as well as airmail. He participated in prestigious national and international philatelic exhibitions and won a number of high-caliber awards. One of his main philatelic contributions was a detailed study of Tuva stamps and their cataloging, which was awarded the silver-plated plaquette at the World Stamp Exhibition "Praga 1962" and posthumously translated and published in English.
