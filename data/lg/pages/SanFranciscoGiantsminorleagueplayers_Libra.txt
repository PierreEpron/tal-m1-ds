He has an above-average arm.... He handles high-velocity fastballs. He’ll turn around a first-pitch breaking ball. He can hit for power to all fields, and because of his speed, almost anything in play has the potential to be an extra-base hit. He isn’t just fast. He’s hungry fast. From the instant he takes off, he’s got the forward body lean of a sprinter stretching for the tape. He has been timed at 3.8 seconds home to first, which is exceptional for a left-handed hitter and elite for someone breaking out of the right-handed batter’s box, like Brown."
