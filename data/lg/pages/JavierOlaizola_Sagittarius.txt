Born in San Sebastián, Gipuzkoa, Olaizola's first professional club was SD Eibar in his native Basque Country, in the second division. Subsequently, he played two seasons with Real Burgos CF, going on to suffer two consecutive drops and returning for a second spell with his previous team afterwards.In 1995, Olaizola signed with RCD Mallorca, immediately becoming an undisputed starter as well as team captain and helping the Balearic Islands side to the 1998 Spanish Supercup against La Liga giants FC Barcelona, as well as a second place in the following year's UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. His first and only goal in the top flight – and overall – came on 17 December 2000, as he scored a last-minute equaliser at RC Celta de Vigo (2–2).

He was himself sacked the following 4 April, after his side was seriously threatened with relegation.Olaizola returned to reserve management on 6 March 2018, taking over Atlético Levante UD of the Tercera División. Four months later, having won their group and then promotion on penalties against UD Ibiza in the play-off final, he left.In June 2019, Olaizola took over at third-tier Arenas Club de Getxo in his native region.
