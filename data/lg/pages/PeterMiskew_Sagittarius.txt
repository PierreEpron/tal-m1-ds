Bahlay.Miskew crossed the floor to the Liberal caucus on February 3, 1934 three days after Premier John Brownlee announced Miskew would move the speech from the throne in the 4th Session of the 7th Alberta Legislative Assembly. Miskew informed the Premier of his decision to cross by a memo and stated that he did not support the policies of the United Farmers government any longer.Miskew achieved his law degree graduating the University of Alberta on May 10, 1935 as part of a class of 20 senior law students. Miskew's tenure as an MLA caused the University to clarify its ban on campus political clubs. President Robert Wallace had originally stated that no student should ally with a political party. He was later forced to clarify that he meant in regards to the ban on political clubs when asked about Miskew and a Social Credit candidate who had attended the University.Miskew retired from provincial politics at dissolution of the Assembly in 1935.
