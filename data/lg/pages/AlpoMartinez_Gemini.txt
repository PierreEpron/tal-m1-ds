In 1985 he met West Side Harlem drug dealer Azie Faison, Martinez started to move up the chain of drug dealers in Harlem and eventually became one of the biggest drug dealers in the city. Martinez later moved to Washington, D.C. to expand operations where he quickly became involved in the city's underworld and elevated his drug activities.
