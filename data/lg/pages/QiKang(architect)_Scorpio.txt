In 1931, Qi was born in Nanjing, China. Qi's mother is Chen Youhe (陈友鹤) and his father is Qi Zhaochang (齐兆昌).
Qi's father was the chief engineer of the Nanjing University (formally Jingling University) from 1920 to 1950. His mother taught Mathematics at Heiwen High School for Girls (which later became Jinling College).

== Projects ==
Qi works to integrate contemporary and Western technology in redefining Chinese Architecture. His work, which stems from Classical principles, is imbued with contemporary innovations. Over the past 50 years, many Chinese architects tend to either adhere to classical forms, or embrace the western approach. Qi Kang has combined the two.
