== Early life and education ==
Farren was born in north Queensland and raised near the Gold Coast from the age of six. Farren always knew he wanted to be an actor: "I can't remember a time when I didn't watch a movie and think, 'That's what I want to do'... Growing up, people said you have to have a plan B. I never felt that, I always thought, nah, this is what I'm going to do." He attended Benowa State High School and studied in its French Immersion Program where students study typical subjects but receive at least half of their schooling in French. Farren graduated from the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) in 2007. He credits actors Daniel Day-Lewis and Gary Oldman as his primary influences and inspiration.

Shooting the film felt like second nature, the scenes would be focused but loose, incredibly tense but hilarious. I never had to say too much to her [Lynch], she would give me a look or whisper one word and I'd get it."Farren's next major role was in the ABC TV tele-movie, Carlotta, playing Danny/Ava, a transgender mate of the main character, that earned him the AACTA Award in 2015 for Best Guest Or Supporting Actor in a Television Drama.
