Her parents removing to Covington, Kentucky, she was not long afterwards married to William Henry Wood, a practicing lawyer of Greensburg, Kentucky; this was in 1849. Two years later, they removed to Sauk Rapids, Minnesota, on the Mississippi River, being the capital and intellectual center of the commonwealth of Minnesota at that time. The following year, William received the appointment of government Land Receiver. William was a person of literary tastes and ability as a writer and orator. In 1860, the Woods edited a weekly newspaper called, The New Era. William died in 1870.Wood was widely known by her pen name, "Minnie Mary Lee". She wrote serial tales and shorter stories for the Catholic Times and Opinion and for the Catholic Fireside, both published in Liverpool, England.

She was at different times in editorial work, including with her son, conducting the Sauk Rapids Free Press.Wood became a convert to the Roman Catholic faith, and wrote several novels more or less advocating the claims of that faith.
