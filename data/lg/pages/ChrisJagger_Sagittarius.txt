=== Guitar company ===
Jagger and his business partner Pat Townshend developed the guitar company Staccato in the mid-1980s. Townshend designed the magnesium alloy guitar, The Staccato. It features a neck and bridge system that could be swapped out.  The user could interchange a bass neck for a six-string neck.  Some models featured no volume or tone pots. The user could activate the volume controls on a touch sensitive LED pad.
A prototype bass was built in Norfolk, England in 1983, and a business partnership was formed to produce Staccato guitars, at the old school house in Woodbastwick, Norfolk. The partners on equal shares were Pat Townshend, Bill Wyman, and Chris and Mick Jagger.  The company went under in 1987. Gene Simmons played a Staccato bass during Kiss' Crazy Nights World Tour.
