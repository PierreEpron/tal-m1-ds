== Biography ==
Alexandrov was born in Moscow and studied at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. He started his career at the Moscow Nemchinov's Theaters in 1887 and in 1896-1898 had a stint with the Society of Art and Literature as a director assistant and actor. In 1898 he joined the Stanislavski troupe, and for the rest of his life worked at the Moscow Art Theater.

In 1904, together with Stanislavsky, he staged three plays by Maurice Maeterlinck: Uninvited, The Blind and There, Inside.
