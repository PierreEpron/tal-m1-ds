Patricio Nazario "Pato" Yáñez Candia (born January 20, 1961, in Valparaíso) is a retired football player from Chile, who obtained 43 caps for his national team, scoring five goals. He made his debut on June 13, 1979, in a friendly against Ecuador, replacing Jorge Neumann, and had his last match on November 16, 1994, against Argentina. He played for his native country in the 1982 FIFA World Cup.


== El Pato Yáñez incident ==

In 1989, during the infamous incident involving the goalkeeper Roberto Rojas in a match against Brazil, Yáñez, under the frustration of believing his team was subject to unfairness, performed a gesture to the Brazilian fans by holding his genitals with both of his hands and his middle body slightly bent towards the front in an act of sexual intercourse. The moment was captured by Chilean national television, and as years have passed, the offensive gesture, when repeated or remembered, is known as "Pato Yáñez".


== Post retirement ==
Following his retirement from football, Yáñez has mainly worked in TV and radio media as a football commentator. He has worked for the Chilean TV channels TVN, Canal 13, Chilevisión, Telecanal and Vive! Deportes, in addition to the Canal del Fútbol from 2014 to 2019. Also, he has worked for the international channels Fox Sports Chile, DirecTV Sports and ESPN Chile. In radio media he has worked for Radio Agricultura and Radio Bío-Bío.
