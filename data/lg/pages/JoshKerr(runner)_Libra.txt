During the postponed 2020 Tokyo Olympics in 2021, Kerr claimed the bronze medal in his specialist event after posting a personal best time of 3m 29.05s, narrowly missing out on silver.
On 27 February 2022, he set an unofficial European mile indoor record (the third fastest mark of all time in the world at the time), and 1500 m & mile British and Scottish indoor records to claim victory at the Boston University Last Chance Meet. With his time of 3:48.87 and 1500 m split of 3:32.86 en route, he broke Eamonn Coghlan's European mile record dating back to 1983, and two Peter Elliott's UK bests, which were set in 1990.
