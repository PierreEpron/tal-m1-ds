Walter Bartky (1901–1958) was an American astronomer, applied mathematician, and educator, noteworthy for his role in the Manhattan Project.


== Education and career ==
Walter Bartky received his B.S. from the University of Chicago in 1923 and his Ph.D. in 1926. At the University of Chicago he was an instructor in 1926, an assistant professor of astronomy from 1927 to 1932, and an associate professor of astronomy from 1932 to 1942. At the University of Chicago he became in 1943 a professor of applied mathematics and associate dean in the Division of Physical Sciences, served from 1945 to 1955 as the dean of the Division of Physical Sciences, and served from 1955 to 1958 as vice president in charge special scientific programs.Walter Bartky was from 1926 to 1930 a consulting mathematician to Western Electric Company. In 1935 his book Highlights of Astronomy was published. During World War II he was the assistant director of the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago.In 1945 he was one of the signers of the Szilárd petition. In May 1945, he accompanied Leo Szilard and Harold Urey to Spartanburg, South Carolina to present a memorandum to James F. Byrnes; the memorandum suggested that dropping an atomic bomb on Japan might start a nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union.
