== Biography ==
Anna Tomcik Olson was born in Atlanta, Georgia. Her parents, Donna and Andy Tomcik, immigrated to Toronto where she grew up. Olson's paternal grandparents came from Slovakia. Olson earned a degree in political science and sociology from Queen's University in Kingston. She also worked for a time in a bank in downtown Toronto. During her lunch breaks, Olson wandered the St. Lawrence Market searching for different ingredients and inspiration for her next dinner party. Olson recalls that she was baking a banana muffin one night after being unable to sleep when she had a "muffin epiphany" and decided to pursue a culinary career. Olson then enrolled in the College of Culinary Arts at Johnson & Wales University in Providence, Rhode Island. Upon her graduation from the university, Olson travelled across the United States. She would eventually find her way to Niagara Falls. Olson was a pastry chef at Inn on the Twenty in Jordan, Ontario for seven years, where she met her husband, chef Michael Olson.Olson's writings include The Inn on the Twenty Cookbook, co-authored by her husband and published in 2000. Olson also published a cookbook called Sugar in 2004. It was a companion to her TV show by the same name which aired on Food Network Canada. Olson co-authored another book with her husband which was released in October 2005. The book is called Anna & Michael Olson Cook at Home: Recipes for Everyday and Every Occasion. This is a menu-driven book which highlights how Olson and her husband cook at home. It also includes tips and tricks for entertaining and weeknight dining. In late 2006, another cookbook with recipes derived from Sugar, called Another Cup of Sugar was released. Olson also writes for publications such as Vines and LCBO Food and Drink.
