Okano publishes manga in magazines across different gendered categories, including shōjo manga, josei manga and seinen manga. Tomoko Yamada assesses that her style is influenced by sentiments of women's media: "One can see this in the graceful beauty of the conduct of Okano’s characters, the picturesque and polished structure of every frame, and the emphasis on subtlety in story development."Her drawing style is influenced by illustrator Motoichiro Takebe. Since Onmyōji, she uses brush and ink in reference to Japanese painting.
