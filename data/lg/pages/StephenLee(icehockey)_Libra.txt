Stephen Lee (born 1 October 1990) is a British ice hockey player formerly playing for Elite Ice Hockey League (EIHL) side Nottingham Panthers and the British national team, who he represented at the 2019 IIHF World Championship.Lee previously played for Nottingham for a decade before returning to fellow EIHL side Guildford Flames in 2019.
He initially agreed to stay in Guildford for a second season in 2020, but due to ongoing coronavirus-induced uncertainty about when or if the 2020-21 Elite League season will start, Lee instead moved to the Alps Hockey League to sign for HC Pustertal WÃ¶lfe on August 30, 2020.In May 2021, it was confirmed Lee would return to Nottingham after two years away from the club.  Sadly, his season was cut short by injury early on, and it was announced on 4 August 2022 that he wouldn't be returning to the Panthers.
