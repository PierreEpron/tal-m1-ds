== Biography ==
A daughter of Methodist Bishop Earl Cranston, Ruth Cranston was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. She was taught by tutors in France and Switzerland, and traveled frequently with her family on her father's missionary work. She returned to the United States for college, and graduated from Goucher College in 1908.  While in college she wrote three articles on what women can do after graduation, which were published in The Delineator. She then went to travel abroad, first to Vienna, where she penned some articles for American publications.Turning to writing novels, she proceeded to publish a number of novels under the pseudonym "Anne Warwick", including seven novels by 1915.  Her first novel, Compensation (1911), caused a stir in Washington, D.C. social circles.  She married William Bleecher Newlin in London in July 1911.  Her last Warwick book was published in 1918.
Cranston returned to the United States in 1919, after working for close to a year with the Red Cross, and by this time apparently divorced.   She later worked in Geneva for ten years promoting international cooperation movements.
Her books published under her own name, which came in her later years, focused on non-fiction and religious subjects, including a biography of Woodrow Wilson (Cranston had gone to college to Wilson's daughters), a history of major religions (World Faith), and The Miracle of Lourdes (1955) about the Our Lady of Lourdes shrine.
She lived in Sierra Madre, California in her later years, and died at St. Luke's Hospital on April 2, 1956, while on a lecture tour. Her New York Times obituary did not mention her early writings as Anne Warwick.The Miracle of Lourdes was last reissued, in an expanded version, in 1988.
