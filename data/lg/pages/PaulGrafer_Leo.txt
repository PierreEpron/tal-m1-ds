He signed with the Charleston Battery on January 28, 1999, but suffered a major neck injury during the pre-season and lost the entire year.  Instead, he spent the entire year coaching with the Williamsburg Soccer Club.  In 2000, he signed with the Long Island Rough Riders, having an excellent season.  That resulted in him being called up to the MetroStars in 2000 after starter Mike Ammann was injured and backup Tim Howard was playing in the Olympics.  In one of the odder moments in MLS history, the league held a draft consisting of only one player, Paul Grafer, after he signed late with the league.  The San Jose Earthquakes selected Grafer, then traded him back to the MetroStars for Ramiro Corrales on February 23, 2001.  He retired following the 2003 season.  In 2005, he returned with the RoughRiders. He played nineteen games and was named second team All League.
