He was elected Mayor of Reggio Calabria in 2002. According to investigations of anti-mafia investigators in 2016, Scopelliti was elected thanks to votes from the 'Ndrangheta, a Mafia-type criminal organisation in Calabria.On 9 October 2012, the Italian government decided to dissolve the city council of Reggio Calabria for infiltration by the 'Ndrangheta. The move came after some councillors were suspected of having ties to the powerful crime syndicate, under the 10-year centre-right rule of Giuseppe Scopelliti, mayor from 2002 to 2010. The investigation was launched in June 2011, following the suicide of Orsola Fallara, Reggio Calabria's council financial controller, who had resigned after government inspectors discovered a €170 million deficit in the Reggio's coffers.

He took 57.8% of the vote, while Loiero lost re-election with 32.2%. Scopelliti took office as President on 30 March 2010.
