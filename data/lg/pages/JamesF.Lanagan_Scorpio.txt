In his first season, the team ended with a 6–2–1 season. Lanagan remained as rugby coach for two more seasons. He also served as Stanford's baseball coach from 1906 to 1907.Lanagan attended Stanford Law School from 1905 to 1907. He resigned from coaching in 1908 to focus on his law practice.During World War I, Lanagan was a major in the United States Army, fighting in France, where he contracted a lung disease that would eventually result in his death two decades later.
