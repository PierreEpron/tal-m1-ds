=== Brighton & Hove Albion ===
Born in Dagenham, Greater London, Hunt joined Brighton & Hove Albion when he was twelve. After progressing through the club's youth system and the development squad, Hunt signed his first professional contract in May 2013.

Hunt made his league debut for Brighton on 17 September against Burton Albion, coming on for Bruno in the 73rd minute. After making his debut, Hunt was quoted as saying: "It was a great experience and I'm just delighted to have made my league debut after coming here when I was 15 or 16. It was a great experience and I thoroughly enjoyed it."Following his good performance in the EFL Cup and the development squad in the first half of the 2017–18 season, Hunt signed a contract with the club, keeping him until 2018. Upon leaving the club, Hunt reflected on his time at Brighton & Hove Albion, quoting: "I can't thank them [Simon and Vic] enough and it feels like I've known them for longer than five or six years. Seeing them every day, learning off them and seeing how good their coaching is, has made me into a better player."


=== Oldham Athletic ===
After being told by the club that he was to be loaned out, Hunt joined League One club Oldham Athletic on 26 January 2017 on a loan deal lasting until the end of the 2016–17 season.
