== California Assembly ==


=== Elections ===
In 2004, incumbent State Assemblywoman Christine Kehoe of California's 76th State Assembly district decided to retire in order to run for a seat in the California Senate. Saldaña ran for the open seat and won the Democratic primary with a plurality of 41% of the vote. In the general election, she defeated Republican Tricia Hunter, a former Assemblywoman, 54%-41%. In 2006, she won re-election to a second term with 64% of the vote. In 2008, she won re-election to a third term with 64% of the vote. She left the Assembly due to term limits in 2010.


=== Tenure ===
In 2007 Saldaña was named Legislator of the Year by Californians Against Waste for her legislation regarding E-waste.In the 2009 session of the state legislature, Saldana introduced three bills that would restrict California's ballot initiative process:

Assembly Bill 6, which would require petition drive management companies to pay an annual fee and register with the California Secretary of State
Assembly Bill 426, which would increase the fee that proponents of an initiative measure are required to pay at the time of submitting the draft of the measure to the Attorney General from $200 to $2,000.
Assembly Bill 1068, which would forbid contracts with signature gatherers premised upon whether or not the measure qualifies for the ballot.Due to California's term limits, Saldaña's assembly career ended on August 31, 2010 in an acrimonious late-night session as she pushed legislation banning the open carry of firearms known as AB 1934. Saldaña presented her bill to the Assembly with 70 minutes remaining in the 2010 regular session, and would not suspend debate when it became clear that its opponents would not let it come to an early vote. Saldaña later clashed with fellow Democrats over their refusal to employ parliamentary procedure tactics to end debate so her measure could be heard.


=== Committee assignments ===
She was appointed Assistant Majority Whip and served on the Appropriations, Natural Resources, Veteran's Affairs, and Water, Parks and Wildlife committees.


== 2012 congressional election ==

Originally, she was planning on running for a seat in the California Senate, but instead decided to run in the newly redrawn California's 52nd congressional district. She came in third place in the open primary and did not advance to the general election, which was ultimately won by Scott Peters.


== 2016 San Diego mayoral election ==

In January 2016, she announced her candidacy for the mayor of San Diego against incumbent mayor Kevin Faulconer in his bid for re-election.

== 2018 San Diego County board of supervisors election ==
In 2018, Saldaña ran for a seat on the officially nonpartisan San Diego County Board of Supervisors.
