This original series pilot was turned down by the National Broadcasting Company (the first television network to broadcast Star Trek), and was only released in 1988 as a filler episode in Paramount Television's Star Trek: The Next Generation television series during a writers' strike.  Bachelin did not receive screen credit for his work on "The Cage".
