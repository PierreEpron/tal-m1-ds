François Jouffroy (1 February 1806 – 25 June 1882) was a French sculptor.


== Biography ==
Jouffroy was born in Dijon, France, the son of a baker, and attended the local drawing school before being admitted to the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1824. In 1832 he won the Prix de Rome. Jouffroy often had to compete with Pierre-Jean David d'Angers for public commissions, but during the Second Empire (1851–1870) he still participated in the decoration of several public buildings.
He was a professor at the École des Beaux-Arts from 1865 until his death. Among his students were Per Hasselberg, Jean Dampt, Léopold Morice, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, José Simões de Almeida (Tio), António Soares dos Reis, Elisa de Lamartine, and Adrien Étienne Gaudez. Jouffroy died at Laval, Mayenne in 1882.
