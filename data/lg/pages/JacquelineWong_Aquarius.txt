=== 2012-2018: Beauty pageants and TVB career ===
Wong competed at Miss Hong Kong 2012 and won the first runner-up title. In the following year, she represented Hong Kong for Miss World 2013 and placed on the top 12 talents.

=== 2019-2021: Taxi Infidelity Scandal with Andy Hui ===

On 16 April 2019, Wong received heavy media exposure for her physical intimacies with married Hong Kong singer and actor Andy Hui; dubbing it "安心". At the time of the incident, Hui was married to singer-actress Sammi Cheng and Wong was in a steady relationship with actor Kenneth Ma. The two shared a taxi ride, where they engaged in intimate acts recorded by the taxi's in-vehicle camera. The video was later made public by various news outlets. Since the scandal broke, Wong blocked comments from her social media accounts after her posts were flooded with negative comments and publicly apologized on social media: "I can’t face myself and do not know how to face my family, Kenneth Ma, friends, company and colleagues... I don’t dare to ask everyone for forgiveness, and only beseech everyone to give some space to all the people who have been implicated."Wong's public image was tarnished and promotions using her image were removed or blocked. She and Ma ended their relationship and Wong returned overseas to Los Angeles for 8 months to avoid public scrutiny and tabloids. During her hiatus, Wong’s scenes in the drama Forensic Heroes IV were re-shot with Roxanne Tong, who began dating Ma in 2020. While Andy Hui is able to salvage his career, Wong's fate remains unknown.After her 8-month hiatus, the dramas Finding Her Voice (牛下女高音) and Handmaiden United (丫鬟大聯盟), in which Wong played major roles, were aired to gauge the public's reaction; the series were met with low ratings. During the promotion of the dramas, she was visibly absent. When reporters asked about any comeback plans or change of careers, she replied she had no plans nor thoughts of it.


=== 2022-2023: Leaving TVB and Free Agency ===
After a three-year career freeze, Wong's contract with TVB eventually ended in July 2022. A free agent, she has yet to return to acting. She has been dating Rubberband drummer Lai Man Wang (泥鯭) and the two live together at Wong's home. On Valentines Day (Tue, Feb 14, 2023), Jacqueline released a music video titled Crown Me (completely in English) with lyrics that addresses some of the criticisms she's received and her readiness to move on.
