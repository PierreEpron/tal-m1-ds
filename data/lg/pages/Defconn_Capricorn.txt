Yoo Dae-joon (Korean: 유대준; January 6, 1977), known by his stage name Defconn, is a South Korean rapper and television personality.


== Biography ==


=== 2004 ===
In 2004, Defconn received the Korean Music Award for "Best Hip-Hop Album". His songs are mostly comical, sometimes involving lyrics about sexual attraction and wishing for more popularity. One song of his, though, centered on the Yangju highway incident in which two South Korean girls lost their lives to an American military tank, which sparked anti-American sentiment in South Korea at the time. He is one of the better known underground rappers in South Korea due to his parallel career as an MC.


=== 2011–present ===
In 2011, he became the host of MBC Every1's Weekly Idol alongside entertainer and comedian Jeong Hyeong-don, a show which was extended from an original six episode special to a weekly show that continues today.
In June 2012, he and Hyungdon formed a hip-hop collaboration called Hyungdon and Daejun.Defconn is a founding member of MBC's I Live Alone, a documentary-style variety program focusing on the real lifestyles of men who live alone. The "Rainbow Club" – a self-designated nickname for the show's hosts – includes both men who are unmarried and men who live alone because their families live overseas. Defconn left the cast in July 2014, citing that he was moving in with his brother and would no longer be living alone.
In November 2013, Defconn became a cast member for the third season of KBS2's Happy Sunday segment 2 Days & 1 Night, and he remained so until 2019, when the third season ended.
