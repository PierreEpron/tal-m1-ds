== Professional career ==
Van Heerden started his professional career in 2006. He quickly emerged as a top fighter in the African continent, which he subsequently proved by snapping South African and ABU welterweight titles. However, in 2010 he suffered his first loss in the professional ring to Serbian Ivica Stevanovic for IBF Inter-Continental light middleweight title. This fight, though, did not stop him from rise to success. In 2009 he prevailed over fellow South African Kaizer Mabuza and gained IBO welterweight belt. He managed to defend his belt twice, against Sebastián Andrés Luján and Matthew Hatton.In Winter 2013 van Heerden decided to relocate to the United States. The move meant that Van Heerden had been forced to relinquish his status as the International Boxing Organisation's champion but it was a move that he considered to pave the way to higher honours in future.
