== Military career ==
During the Second World War, McRae served in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve.  He was Surgeon Lieutenant on HMS Mahratta when it was torpedoed by the German submarine U-990.In 1941–1945 The Arctic Lookout, Noel Simon recounts a story he was told of McRae's actions after the sinking:

Having managed to climb onto one of the few Carley floats to have come through the sinking, he set about hauling the others aboard. The float soon became overcrowded.  Remarking almost casually; "There's not enough room for us all" the doctor slipped over the side into the sea and was never seen again.

He is commemorated on the Portsmouth Naval Memorial.
