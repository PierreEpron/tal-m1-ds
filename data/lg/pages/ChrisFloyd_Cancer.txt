Floyd enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1994 and played for the Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1994 to 1997.As a freshman in 1994, Floyd was a backup to Tyrone Wheatley and Tshimanga Biakabutuka at the tailback position. Floyd carried the ball in four games, rushing for 71 yards on 10 carries (10.1 yards per carry), including a career-long 54-yard run against Minnesota on October 28, 1995.  At the end of the 1994 season, Floyd was asked to backup Ch√© Foster at fullback for the 1994 Holiday Bowl.As a sophomore, Floyd moved to the fullback position, where he started six games for the 1995 Michigan team. He carried the ball 48 times during the 1995 season for 194 net rushing yards (3.8 yards per carry).As a junior, Floyd started seven games at fullback for the 1996 Michigan team. He carried the ball 30 times during the 1995 season for 101 net rushing yards (3.4 yards per carry). After the 1996 season, Floyd was frustrated with his limited role as a fullback and considered transferring to another school. Assistant coaches Mike Gittleson and Mike DeBord persuaded him to stay.As a senior, Floyd started eight games at fullback for the undefeated 1997 team that compiled a 12-0 record, outscored opponents 322-144, and was ranked #1 in the final AP Poll. He carried the ball 63 times for 269 yards and two touchdowns in 1997. His larger contributions were as a blocker. He saved quarterback Brian Griese from blitzing defenders numerous times during the 1997 season. Floyd considered the 1997 Ohio State game to be his best at Michigan. He made numerous blocks in the game, including a key block on Na'il Diggs that allowed Griese the time needed to throw a 37-yard pass to Charles Woodson for Michigan's first touchdown. Floyd later recalled, "It got to the point where I knew [Ohio State blitzers] were coming and they knew I was going to block them. I would point at the guy blitzing and tell him to bring it on."In four years at Michigan, Floyd carried the ball 148 times for 623 net rushing yards and two touchdowns.  He also caught 14 passes for 125 receiving yards.
