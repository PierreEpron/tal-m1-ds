== International career ==

During 2012, Levi played 13 international Twenty20 matches for South Africa. He had the highest score of 117*, in his second match, against New Zealand at Seddon Park in Hamilton. He held the record for the most runs scored in a Twenty20 international innings tied with Chris Gayle. This was surpassed by Brendon McCullum on 21 September 2012 when he scored 123 against Bangladesh at Palakelle, Sri Lanka. He was also the only batsman to score a T20I century at Seddon Park.
Levi has since struggled in International cricket, partly due to being a predominantly leg-side batsman and weak against spin bowling and dropped from the South Africa squad.
