Mast Mast Dam Mast Qalandar
Vigar Gai Ae Thore Dina Taun
Yaara Dak Le Khooni Ankhiyan Noon
Ranjha Te Mera Rabb Warga
Dil Mar Jane Nu Ki Hoya Sajna
Sunn Charkhe Di Mitthi Mitthi Kook
Ho Jave Je Piyar
Mailey Ne Vichar Jana
Wadah Kar ke Sajjan Nahee Aya
Gin Gin Taare Langhdiya Raata
Kamli walay Muhammad tu Sadqa mein jan
Kinna Sohna Teinu Rab Ne Banaya, Dil Karay Vekhda Rahwan
