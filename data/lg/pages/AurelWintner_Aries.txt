Aurel Friedrich Wintner (8 April 1903 – 15 January 1958) was a mathematician noted for his research in mathematical analysis, number theory, differential equations and probability theory.  He was one of the founders of probabilistic number theory.  He received his Ph.D. from the University of Leipzig in 1928 under the guidance of Leon Lichtenstein. He taught at Johns Hopkins University.
He was a nephew of the astronomer Samuel Oppenheim, and the son-in-law of mathematician Otto Hölder.
