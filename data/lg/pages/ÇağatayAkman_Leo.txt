== Artistry ==
I am making universal music. Everyone calls it rap but it's not rap. [It's] rhythmic music, I do not rap, and I can use my voice. Rhythmic songs turn straight in rap. They call it rap because it's a bit smoothing. I can sing in any style. I try to sing in all styles as far as I can.
Çağatay Akman, who can play guitar, is described as a rap music artist, but he states what he does is fluid and his style is not necessarily rap. Akman, who said that he tries to create his own style, believes that no one has the same style of music as his.

With his music, he reaches out to a large number of people, and has become the voice of a quiet majority."On 19 January 2017, Mevlüt Tezel from Sabah published an article titled "Çağatay Akman deception" and claimed that Akman's song, in fact, had fake views on YouTube and gave spurious social messages, and that Akman's only desire was to become famous.In his article for Hürriyet, published on 8 March 2017, Cengiz Semerciğlu argued that Çağatay Akman was an 18-year-old guy with great talent who had emerged from the difficult conditions in Zeytinburnu.Kâmuran Akdemir from Gecce wrote the article "Çağatay Akman's success!" that was published on 26 October 2017.
