== Controversy ==
Brye was involved in one of the biggest controversies in baseball on the final day of the 1976 season. Kansas City's George Brett and Hal McRae were in a near deadlock for the American League batting championship.  In his final at-bat, Brett hit a routine fly-ball to left field that Brye failed to catch, and it fell for a hit.  There were accusations that Brye played it badly to deny McRae, an African American, the batting championship. Within baseball circles, rumours persisted that Brye didn't see McRae as an equal to Brett because Brett played defense, whereas McRae was a designated hitter. It was never conclusively established that Brye intentionally failed to retire Brett.
