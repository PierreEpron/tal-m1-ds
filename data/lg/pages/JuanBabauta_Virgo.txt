In November 2001, Babauta was elected Governor of the Northern Mariana Islands in the four-way gubernatorial election as a Republican. Babauta and his running mate, Diego Benavente, won the election with 5,512 votes, the largest number of votes ever received by a gubernatorial candidate in the Northern Mariana Islands at the time. He defeated Covenant Party candidate Benigno Fitial, Democrat Jesus Borja and former Governor and then Reform Party candidate Froilan Tenorio, respectively. Babauta and Benavente were sworn into office on January 14, 2002.
Babauta was defeated for re-election in the 2005 gubernatorial election. The Republican party refused to hold a primary against former Speaker  (2002-2004) Heinz Hofschneider. Babauta and Benavente eventually came in third place in the gubernatorial election, behind Covenant Party candidate Benigno Fitial and Hofschneider, running as an independent, in an election that marked the worst defeat for the Republican Party in its history. 
 Benigno Fitial was elected Governor over independent Heinz Hofschneider by just 99 votes after fifteen days tallying absentee ballots, the closest gubernatorial election in Northern Mariana Islands history at the time. Fitial won with 3809 votes (28.07%) while independent Hofschneider came in a close second with 3,710 votes (27.33%). Babauta placed a disappointing third place with 3,610 votes, or 26.66%. Froilan Tenorio came in fourth with 2442 votes (17.99%). In a concession speech at his home, Babauta told supporters, "Nobody's to blame but me." Babauta left office on January 9, 2006.Four years later, Babauta unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination in the 2009 gubernatorial election with running mate, Galvin S. Deleon Guerrero, the principal at Mount Carmel School. Babauta was defeated in the Republican primary election on June 27, 2009, by Heinz Hofschneider.

Sablan won re-election to a second term, while Babauta placed third in the race.
