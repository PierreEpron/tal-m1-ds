Lopez graduated from Traphagen School of Fashion in 1955 in Illustration.While attending F.I.T. as a student in 1962, he began an internship at Women's Wear Daily which led to him leaving school and working at the publication. Shortly afterward he left for a freelance position at the New York Times.

Lopez and Ramos also discovered Pat Cleveland, Grace Jones, and Tina Chow.In additions to books of his fashion illustration, the book Antonio's Tales From the Thousand and One Nights was published in 1985.  The book was the inspiration for Marc Jacobs' 2007 "Arabian Nights" event.A book on the career of Antonio Lopez, Antonio Lopez: Fashion, Art, Sex, & Disco, by Roger Padilha and Mauricio Padilha (with a foreword by Andre Leon Talley and an epilogue by Anna Sui), was published by Rizzoli in September 2012.Lopez explored themes of queer desire and race in his art through cultural references to subjects, such as Josephine Baker and The Wild One.
