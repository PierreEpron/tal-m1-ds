Abraham Eraly (15 August 1934 â€” 8 April 2015) was an Indian writer of history, a teacher, and the founder of Chennai-based magazine Aside.


== Early life ==
Abraham Eraly was born in the village of Ayyampalli in Ernakulam district, Kerala on 15 August 1934. He studied history at a college in Ernakulam and followed it up with a postgraduate degree in the same subject at Madras Christian College in Chennai. He became a professor of history at MCC in 1971.Bored with the monotony of teaching, Eraly resigned his professorship in 1977 and founded the Chennai-based magazine Aside, India's first English-language city magazine. Following financial difficulties, it closed in 1997.


== Literary career ==
Eraly's earliest publications were poems and short stories.Abraham Early in an interview with journalist and author, talks to Shreekumar Varma says:

History is about life. You can't invent even the minutest fact, but there is scope for visualising what had happened.
His historical writing career started while at Madras Christian College. Dissatisfied with the material he used to teach history, he began to write a series of books on Indian history. The Gem in the Lotus covered its earliest period, while The Last Spring continued the narration to the end of the Mughal Empire.  Eraly's style of historical story-telling made him particularly approachable for non-historians but could also be used as a reliable source on the Mughal period in India.


== Later life ==
In 2011, Eraly moved to Pondicherry, where he lived in Sarathambal Nagar.Abraham Eraly died at the JIPMER hospital on 8 April 2015, following a paralytic attack.
