She also formed the C.G. Jung Study Group, which she chaired until 1968.Her research on occupational therapy and the understanding of the psychotic process through images of the unconscious gave origin, along the years, to exhibitions, films, documentaries, audiovisuals, courses, symposiums, publications and conferences.

Her work and ideas inspired the creation of museums, cultural centers, and therapeutic institutions in Brazil and overseas.On July 8, 2022, her name was writhed in Brazilian "Livro dos Heróis e Heroínas da Pátria" (Book of Heroes and Heroines of the Motherland) by Brazilian Federal Law 14.401/2022.
