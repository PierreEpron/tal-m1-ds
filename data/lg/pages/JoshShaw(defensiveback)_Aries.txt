Prior to his senior season in August 2014, Shaw was suspended by USC after he lied about how he suffered injuries to both his ankles. He had originally told the team that he injured himself while jumping from the second story of an apartment building to save his nephew who was drowning in a pool. In reality, he suffered the injuries after jumping from his balcony to avoid the police who had been called by a neighbor after hearing an argument between him and his girlfriend. The police looked into possible domestic violence charges; however, no charges were filed due to insufficient evidence. Shaw was reinstated in November 2014 and played in the final three games of the season.
