Ernest Ewart Gladstone Alderwick (4 April 1886 â€“ 26 August 1917) was an English cricketer who played as a right-handed batsman for Gloucestershire in 1908. He was born in Bristol and died in the First World War at Peronne on the Somme.
Alderwick made his debut as a lower-order batsman against Worcestershire, against whom he scored just seven runs in two innings, while his team went down to a 225-run defeat. He played in the next game, three days after his first and against Northamptonshire, but he scored a duck in his only innings before the match was abandoned for a draw. In 1914, he played a couple of Minor Counties games as an opening batsman for Suffolk.
