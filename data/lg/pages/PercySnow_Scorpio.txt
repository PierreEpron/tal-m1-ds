Snow was a consensus selection on the 1989 College Football All-America Team at Michigan State and was voted the player of the game in the 1988 Rose Bowl.

== NFL career ==
Snow had a successful rookie season in 1990 and was expected to be a major contributor to Marty Schottenheimer's powerful defense with the Kansas City Chiefs. However, he was involved in an accident while riding a scooter during training camp in 1991. Snow sustained season-ending injuries to his knee in the wreck and never fully recovered from the accident. His career ended after only three active seasons (he spent 1991 on injured reserve) with just one start in his final two.
After leaving the NFL, Snow later played for the Rhein Fire in the World League of American Football (WLAF).


== Personal life ==
Snow is the older brother of Eric Snow, who played the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1995 to 2008.
