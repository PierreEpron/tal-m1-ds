=== Anti-Naxal movement ===
Karma was seen as the driving force behind anti-Naxal movements in the Chhattisgarh. In 1991, he had started Jan Jagran Abhiyan which was composed mostly of traders and businessmen. The movement collapsed after sometime. Because of his role against Maoists, Karma was a high-value target. Owing to the threat perception to his life by the Maoists, he was given Z+ security for his protection.


== Death ==
On 25 May 2013, Karma was killed in the Maoist attack in Darbha along with several other party leaders including Nand Kumar Patel when they were returning from a political rally.
On 27 May, the Naxalites claimed responsibility for the attack by issuing a statement which called the attack "the punishment for Salwa Judum founder Mahendra Karma for the atrocities done by the Salwa Judum-Nand Kumar Patel was suppressing people. It was in his tenure in the Center when paramilitary forces were deployed in the Bastar area."The newly elected INC government of Chhattisgarh has set up an SIT under Vivekanand Sinha to probe into the incident on January 2, 2019.
