Božo Biškupić (born 26 April 1938 in Mala Mlaka, near Zagreb) is a Croatian politician and lawyer. He served as Minister of Culture of Croatia in the governments of three Croatian Prime Ministers: Zlatko Mateša (1995–2000), Ivo Sanader (2003–2009) and Jadranka Kosor (2009–2010). Therefore his two non-consecutive ministerial terms (1995–2000 and 2003–2010) amount to a total of 11 years and 87 days, the longest tenure of any minister in a Croatian Government since independence in 1991.
