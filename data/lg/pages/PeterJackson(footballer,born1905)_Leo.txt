He became a very useful back-up player in Tom Mather's but could only manage a few matches consecutively as he suffered with leg spasms. As a result, he averaged around ten games per season but he did play in 22 matches in 1930–31. In total Jackson spent ten seasons at the Victoria Ground making 74 appearances scoring once which came in a 3–1 win over Southampton on 25 March 1933.

He made history by giving debuts to his twin sons Peter and David.Jackson Senior moved to Bradford City in February 1955 after Ivor Powell was sacked.
