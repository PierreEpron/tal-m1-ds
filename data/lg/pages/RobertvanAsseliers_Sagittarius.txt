Robert van Asseliers (2 December 1576 – 28 November 1661) was the chancellor of Brabant from 1651 until 1661.


== Early life ==
Coming from a family of officeholders in the duchy of Brabant, Asseliers studied at the University of Leuven, graduating as a Doctor of Law. He married Antoinette Vandenberghe in 1608; they had a son and two daughters.


== Career ==
In 1619, Asseliers succeeded his father as a councillor on the Council of Brabant. He went on to become a member of the Privy Council of the Habsburg Netherlands], the Council of State, and the Supreme Council of Flanders in Madrid. 

Asseliers became chancellor of Brabant on 5 May 1651. Because of his advanced age—taking office at the age of 74—a vice-chancellor, Joannes van Thulden, brother of Diodorus Tuldenus, was appointed to help him in office. Asseliers died on 28 November 1661.
