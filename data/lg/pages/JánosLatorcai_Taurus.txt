The protesting MPs, led by Jobbik head Gábor Vona, were ordered by deputy speaker Latorcai to vacate the lectern, but they refused, leading to a delay in the session and the exclusion of the protesters from the vote. As the votes were being counted, Jobbik lawmakers shouted slogans including "Traitors" and "No, no, never," the latter a traditional protest chant against the post-World War I Treaty of Trianon.
