== Controversy ==
Bilikis Abiodun Otunla, who won gold in the -81 kg category at the 2019 African Weightlifting Championships was suspended following her failed anti-doping test, a result that saw her violating the anti-doping rule. However the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) revealed a public disclosure on reports about the sample of her test,  which says; “An Adverse Analytical Finding for metenolone and metenolone metabolite -1-methylene-5α-androstane-3α-ol-17-one (S1.1 Anabolic agents). As a consequence, the Athlete is provisionally suspended in view of a potential anti-doping rule violation. In any case, where it is determined that the Athlete did not commit an anti-doping rule violation, the relevant decision will also be published. IWF will not make any further comments on the case until it is closed.”
