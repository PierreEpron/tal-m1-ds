Graeme David Bridge (born 4 September 1980) is a former English first-class cricketer.
Born in Sunderland, Bridge is a right-handed batsman and a left-arm slow bowler. He played for Durham and the Durham Cricket Board for the entirety of his first-class career. His debut came in the AXA County Championship in 1999, where he took the wicket of Gary Butcher. He never managed to establish himself on a regular basis and was released at the end of the 2006 season. Unable to find another club, he drifted away from the first-class game.
He plays in the North East Premier League for Blaydon Cricket Club, which he has captained. Despite many games being abandoned due to rain, he was a leading wicket taker in the 2007 season, as he has been in most seasons.
