Christian Jacob Theophilus de Meza (November 26, 1756 – April 6, 1844) was a Danish physician and author.


== Biography ==
De Meza was born in Copenhagen in 1756. He was the son of the physician Christian de Meza, together with whom he embraced Christianity in 1783. In the same year he graduated as M.D. from the University of Copenhagen, and became a member of the Royal Medical Society. From 1784 until his death he practised medicine in Elsinore.
Meza published in the medical journals numerous essays. He also wrote also a drama, Dormon og Vilhelmine, which was produced at the Royal Theatre, Copenhagen, in 1796.
Meza's son, Christian Julius de Meza (1792–1865), was a general in command of a division of the Danish army during the Second Schleswig War.
