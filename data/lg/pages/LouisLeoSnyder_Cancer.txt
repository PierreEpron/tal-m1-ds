Louis Leo Snyder (4 July 1907 – 25 November 1993) was an American scholar, who witnessed first hand the Nazi mass rallies held from 1923 on in Germany; and wrote about them from New York in his Hitlerism: The Iron Fist in Germany published in 1932 under the pseudonym Nordicus. Snyder predicted Adolf Hitler's rise to power, Nazi alliance with Benito Mussolini, and possibly the war upon the French and the Jews. His book was the first publication of the complete NSDAP National Socialist Program in the English language.

He compiled the Encyclopedia of the Third Reich (1976), wrote Roots of German Nationalism (1978), and Diplomacy in Iron (1985) among other works examining the Third Reich. He also wrote The Dreyfus Case (1973) which divided France over the Dreyfus affair at turn of the century.
