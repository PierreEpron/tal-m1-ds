Born in Callao, Acasiete started playing professionally with Deportivo Wanka, moving in the following year to Universitario de Deportes.

For 2004–05, Acasiete signed with UD Almería in the Spanish second division. He was an important defensive element in the Andalusians first-ever promotion to La Liga in 2007, being used intermittently in the subsequent seasons however: in his first top level campaign in Spain he appeared in only 20 games, but still managed to award his team six points with last-minute home strikes against Sevilla FC and Villarreal CF (both 1–0).Following the end of 2011–12, spent again in the second level, 34-year-old Acasiete opted out of his contract with Almería and returned to his former club Cienciano.


== International career ==
Acasiete gained more than 40 caps for the Peru national team, the first on 18 February 2004 at almost 27, and participated at the 2004 and 2007 Copa América.
On 7 December 2007, he was found guilty of having introduced women and alcohol into the national squad's hotel two days before Peru's away drubbing at the hands of Ecuador (5–1), and was thus suspended 18 months (1.5 years) from international competition (national sides only). On 3 July of the following year, after an investigation and a review of the facts, the suspension was changed to three months (from the date of appeal in April) with a US$10,000 fine.
