Lemuel Tukey (August 6, 1766 – July 22, 1835) was an American businessman from Portland, Maine. The city's Tukey's Bridge is named for him.  He ran a tavern on the Portland end of a previous version of the bridge, which was completed in 1796, and objected to the city's decision to end the collection of tolls, so he collected them anyway until he was forced to stop in the early 1830s.In 1823, Tukey was registered as a distiller and a mountfort.
