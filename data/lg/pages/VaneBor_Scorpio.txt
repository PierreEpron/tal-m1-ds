He produced various collages, photograms and photographs, as well as theoretical texts and poems. He is best known for his books "Vane Bor i Marko Ristić" and "Anti-zid" which influenced many writers, including Aleksandar Vučo, Marko Ristić, Rastko Petrović, Oskar Davičo, and others.
He was born in the mining village of Bor, from which he took his pseudonym. His parents were Dragutin and Desanka Živadinović, both prominent doctors. His sister, Jelica, became better known as Ševa Ristić, also a surrealist artist and married to Marko Ristić.
