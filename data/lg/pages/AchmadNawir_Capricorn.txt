Achmad Nawir (June 30th, 1912 – April 1st, 1995) was a Indonesia doctor and footballer. Nawir played for a local club HBS Soerabaja and also the Indonesia national football team.


== Career ==
He is noted for captaining of the Indonesia national football team while it crashed out in defeat to Hungary at the 1938 FIFA World Cup, 6–0. Curiously, the other captain, György Sárosi, had a doctorate degree, the same as Nawir. Nawir wore his studious glasses for the match. Indonesia automatically qualified for the tournament after their original opponents, Japan, withdrew from the qualifying round. He is one of the few players to wear glasses in the World Cup. Nawir and most of his teammates only played in two international matches, one against Hungary in the World Cup and another against Netherlands, losing 9–2 in a friendly game just after the World Cup. It was the last international match for "Dutch East Indies", which became the independent nation of Indonesia in 1945.
