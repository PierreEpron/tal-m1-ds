In the semi-finals, David and Japanese athlete, Shusei Nomoto, tied for the final non-automatic qualifying position with a time of 7.565. As there were no additional lanes available, a drawing of lots took place which saw David advance to the final as a result of his race bib labelled "King" being randomly drawn from a bag.
