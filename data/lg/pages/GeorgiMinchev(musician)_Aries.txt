Georgi Minchev (Bulgarian: Георги Минчев; 9 April 1943 – 18 February 2001), also called Gosho Minchev or Zhoro Minchev, was a Bulgarian rock musician, singer, songwriter and TV presenter.
He is best known as one of the pioneers of the rock music genre in Bulgaria as well as one of the advocates of the restoration of the democracy in the country. Many of his songs became classic rock hits most notably White Silence, Blessed years, The Bulgarian Rock, Balance, The Song of the singer, Alone at the Bar, A Story with Guitar and Almost Midnight.
During the 1990s, he was a co-founder of the supergroup Stari Mutsuni (Old faces) which featured also Petar Gyuzelev and Georgi Markov of Shturtsite and Ivaylo Kraychovski and Ivan Lechev of FSB.
After his death in 2001, the rock music festival "Flower for Gosho" was established in his honor. It takes place in Sofia during the summer.
