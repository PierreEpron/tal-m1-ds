His son, Edgardo L. Paras, became an associate justice of the Supreme Court from 1986 to 1992.According to Justice J.B.L. Reyes, during the deliberations of the People v. Hernandez rebellion case, Justice Sabino Padilla (who is the brother of the solicitor general arguing for the government) openly accused Chief Justice Paras of being prejudiced against the government and asking biased questions during the oral argument. Riled, Parás rebutted, and a heated exchange soon ensued, which would have worsened had not they restrained themselves.
