In 1916, he and the company chairman, Mark Napier, who was himself a financier, bought the company, with money being advanced to Jones by Sir Starr Jameson, chairman of the British South Africa Company. During the rest of the War, Reuters followed a carefully patriotic line, so much so that Jones was accused of being the British government's Head of Propaganda.

In 1923, Reuters became the first news agency to use radio for sending news to its subscribers.Jones became chairman of Reuters as well as general manager and retired from those posts in 1941. The company was restructured, so that its ownership was transferred to the newspapers subscribing to it.
