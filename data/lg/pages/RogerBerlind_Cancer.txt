== Early life ==
Berlind was born to a Jewish family in New York City, to Mae (née Miller) and Peter Sydney Berlind, a hospital administrator. He attended Princeton University and received his bachelor's degree in English in 1954 after completing an 82-page long senior thesis titled "The Quest of the Ideal in the Plays of Yeats and Synge". Berlind was a member of the Princeton Tower Club. The crash of Eastern Air Lines Flight 66 on June 24, 1975 killed his wife, Helen Polk Clark, and three of his four children.

His theatrical producing career began in 1976. Since then, he has produced or co-produced more than forty plays and musicals on Broadway and many off-Broadway and regional theatre productions as well.
