== Tennis career ==


=== 2009 ===
Veić received a wild card for Zagreb Indoors and caused an upset as he beat ex-top 10 player Guillermo Cañas 4–6, 6–4, 6–2. Betfair started an internal investigation after Cañas had been "trading as a rank outsider" although Veić was considered an underdog before the match. Veić issued a brief statement calling the allegations 'ridiculous and unfounded'. Veić continued his successful run following a 3–6, 7–6, 6–4 victory over Evgeny Korolev. It came to an end after he lost to fellow Croat Marin Čilić 6–2, 7–6.


=== 2010 ===
Veic qualified for the 2010 Australian Open Men's Singles draw, where he beat Daniel Köllerer of Austria 6–4, 3–6, 6–7, 6–1, 6–4. He fell to Gaël Monfils 6–4, 6–4, 6–4.
