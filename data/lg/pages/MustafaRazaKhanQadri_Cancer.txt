Mustafa Raza Khan Qadri (1892–1981) was an Indian Sunni Muslim scholar and author, and leader of the Sunni Barelvi movement following the death of its founder, his father Ahmed Raza Khan.  He was known as Mufti-Azam-i-Hind to his followers.  In a biography compiled by Muhammad Afthab Cassim Razvi he is referred to as Mufti-e-Azam-e-Hind.

== Life ==
He wrote books on Islam in Arabic, Urdu, Persian, and announced judgments on several thousand Islamic problems in his compilation of fatawa Fatawa-e-Mustafwia. Thousands of Islamic scholars were counted as his spiritual successors. 
He was the main leader of the Jama'at Raza-e-Mustafa in Bareilly, which opposed the Shuddhi movement to convert Muslims to Hinduism in pre-Partition India. 
During the time of emergency in 1977 in India, he issued a fatwa against vasectomy which was made compulsory and 6.2 million Indian men were sterilized in just a year. In such circumstances Mustafa Raza Khan argued this order of Indian government given by Indira Gandhi.
