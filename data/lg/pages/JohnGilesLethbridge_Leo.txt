He was born in Fingal, Canada West, the son of George Lethbridge who had come to Canada from England. In 1880, he married Lydian Jane Tristain. A farmer, he was educated at London Commercial College. He was appointed to Master and Secretary of the Dominion Grange, an agrarian advocacy organization.

Following the resignation of William Raney, Lethbridge, at the age of 72, was elected leader of the Progressive Party on November 18, 1927 at a joint meeting of Progressive MPPs and the party executive.As leader, Lethbridge supported a strong temperance policy in opposition to the liberalization of liquor laws by the government of Howard Ferguson. His leadership could not stop the decline of the party and in the 1929 provincial election the Progressive bloc elected only five MLAs with Lethbridge being one of the casualties.
