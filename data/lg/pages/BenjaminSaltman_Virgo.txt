In 1967 he received a Ph.D. from Claremont Graduate School where he wrote his doctoral thesis "The Descent to God: Religious Language in Several Contemporary American Poets".

== Career ==
Saltman was the recipient of two literature fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1969 and 1987. In 1992, after retiring, he volunteered to teach at California State University Northridge for free after state budget cuts caused the school to cancel 1,000 courses previously scheduled for the fall semester.

After reading the Swami Prabhavananda's translation and commentary on the Bhagavad Gita, Saltman started frequenting lectures at the Vedanta Society of Southern California along with disciples Aldous Huxley and Christopher Isherwood.
