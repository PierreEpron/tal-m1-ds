The doctor recommended her to take ballet classes. At age 8 Brenda began ballet in a local school in Guadalajara called Victoria Ballet Guadalajara. She commented that "At first it was for medical reasons then I learned to love it." At age 12 Brenda left for Mexico City to take a few ballet classes. She commented that "When I attended my first class at the school the teacher commented how late I started ballet and told me I should just have become a model." Brenda was taught by many teachers that were recognized in the state of Jalisco such as Carmen Sandoval, Carmen Pardon, Segui, Vicencio, Guillermo Hernandez, Ricardo Costo and Alejandro Zybin.
