=== Comments about Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 ===
Following the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 incident, Yesayan, alongside another test pilot Magomed Tolboyev, criticized the Russian version about the airliner's shootdown by a Ukrainian Sukhoi Su-25 aircraft: "Someone, unfamiliar with Su-25's capabilities and the Boeing-777 aircraft, is trying a PR stunt. This is a natural bluff. [...] Su-25 has a maximum airspeed of Mach 0.82. The Boeing-777 aircraft, which I tested in 1998 in Seattle, flies at Mach 0.83 in a cruise flight. Thus, a Su-25 would not be able to catch up with it at all". Yesayan also noted that the Su-25 air-to-air missiles are heat-seeking and would strike the engine, while the Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 Boeing was damaged on the cockpit side.
