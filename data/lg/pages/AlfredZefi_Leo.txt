=== Korabi Peshkopi ===
On 1 July 2016, Zefi joined newly promoted Albanian Superliga side Korabi Peshkopi by penning a one-year contract for an undisclosed fee. He signed along with 12 other players, five of them being his teammates at Laçi. He was given squad number 22, and made his competitive debut on 7 September in the opening 2016–17 Albanian Superliga week against Laçi, appearing in the last 13 minutes of an eventual goalless draw. On 12 February of the following year, during the matchday 21 against Luftëtari Gjirokastër, Zefi was sent-off in the 61st minute for headbutting a player of Luftëtari, as the match finished with a 2–0 defeat for Zefi's side. This led the Disciplinary Committee to ban him for the following five league matches.


=== Kamza ===
In July 2017, Zefi signed with fellow promoted top flight side Kamza. He played his first match for his new side on 9 September in the opening week of 2017–18 Albanian Superliga against Kukësi, playing 64 minutes in a 1–0 loss. In his first season at Kamza, Zefi made 17 league appearances as Kamza retained their top flight spot by winning in the final matchday against Partizani Tirana. He left the club in July 2018.
