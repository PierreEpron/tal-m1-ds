== Career ==
Born in Cork, Dorgan first came to prominence on the Glasheen team who beat Home Farm in the FAI Youth Cup. Blackburn Rovers manager Jackie Carey was impressed with the young Dorgan and within weeks he was signed to the English club. After three years at Blackburn and shortly after the start of the 1957–58 season he signed for League of Ireland debutants Cork Hibernians. In 1966 Dorgan moved to Cork Celtic when their centre half John Coughlan retired. His tenure here was brief, however, he continued to play with the Aer Lingus team in the Cork Shipping League, until the mid-1980s.
