Brian Andrew Murphy (born 1 December 1976) is a Rhodesian-born former Zimbabwean cricketer and a former captain of limited over cricket for Zimbabwe. He played his cricket for Mashonaland in Zimbabwe and Western Province in South Africa. He played a total of 11 Test matches and 31 One Day Internationals for Zimbabwe, and was the surprise choice as captain when Heath Streak stepped down in 2001. However, after four ODIs and one Test he sustained a hand injury and relinquished the captaincy, which was then awarded to Stuart Carlisle.
Murphy returned to international cricket after recovering from injury, playing in the 2003 Cricket World Cup before quitting Zimbabwe for England where he was offered a contract to play club cricket. He also took a job, coaching at the University of Cape Town in South Africa.
