Fandas Shakirovich Safiullin (Russian: Фандас Шакирович Сафиуллин, 17 August 1936 – 10 October 2021) was a Russian politician. A member of the Fatherland – All Russia party, he served in the Third State Duma from 1999 to 2003.  As an ethnic Tatar, Safiullin fought for the rights of his people; for example, the right to use the Latin alphabet instead of the Cyrillic one.
Safiullin died from COVID-19 in October 2021.  The death of Safiullin was, according to poet Razil Valeev, "a great loss to the people and the nation".
