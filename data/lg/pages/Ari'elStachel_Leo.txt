Stachel was born and raised in Berkeley, California.

His parents divorced when he was young, and he chose to use his mother's last name in part to avoid being associated with his father's Middle Eastern background. He was in fifth grade when the 9/11 terror attacks occurred, and rather than be identified as part Arab, he told friends he was half Black. As a teenager, he avoided being seen in public with his father, and even excluded him from his high school graduation, as he "didn’t want to be seen with somebody who looked like an Arab." He finally embraced his heritage after being cast in The Band's Visit.Stachel had his first role in a school musical at age 15, after which he left Berkeley High School to attend the Oakland School for the Arts.
