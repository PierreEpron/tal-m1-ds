Loaned out to Tampines Rovers of the Singapore S.League in 2003, Groves took part in a few training sessions with the club before marking his S.League debut against Jurong, getting a minor concussion and being stretchered off the field with 12 minutes left to go.Then Tampines Rovers' coach Des Bulpin stated that he needed to participate in two to three games in order to settle in. We have seen in training the talent he has and what he will bring to our team. His vision and ball retention are second to none. I'm excited to see what he produces throughout the season.
