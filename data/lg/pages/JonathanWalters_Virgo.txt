== Club career ==


=== Blackburn Rovers ===
Walters was born in Moreton, Merseyside and started his career at Blackburn Rovers having been spotted by playing for Shaftesbury under 16s in the Eastham & District Junior League by Rovers' scout for Wirral and Wales, Mike O'Brien who moved quickly to sign him.

"He was at Shaftesbury under-16s when I first decided he had something. I had been watching him for the previous two years but his physique wasn't what it should be. But once he got to 16 you could see him developing. He was always quick. He played against Tranmere Rovers and scored three for Merseyside Schools, so I made the decision to bring him in and he scored two against Manchester United on the Saturday and we signed him on the Monday. If a player is a bit special you need to make a quick decision. And it paid off because the gaffer (Graeme Souness) thinks a lot of him. But I'll never predict what he can do or if he is close to making the first team. All I will say is the lad is scoring goals for the reserves and if he continues to do that he's got a chance."
He played for Blackburn's youth and reserve teams where he scored prolifically, helping the club reach the FA Youth Cup final in 2001, losing 6–3 on aggregate to Arsenal. However his promising career with Rovers was ended due to a 'serious breach of club discipline' which was described as 'totally out of character' and saw him suspended by the club.


=== Bolton Wanderers ===
He then joined Bolton Wanderers for a fee of £50,000 following interest from numerous clubs. He played in four Premier League games for Bolton making his professional debut as an 85th-minute substitute in a 2–1 defeat to Charlton Athletic, before signing for Hull City on loan in 2003. On his debut for Hull Walters scored twice in a 5–1 win over Carlisle United. Following his loan spell at Hull, Walters returned to Bolton, where he again went out on loan, this time to Crewe Alexandra however he failed to make an appearance for Crewe due to a tooth infection. In the 2003–04 season he joined Barnsley on loan and played eight league games for the "Tykes".


=== Hull City ===
Walters signed for Hull City for a second time in 2004, this time on a permanent transfer. In February 2005, he joined Scunthorpe United on a one-month loan deal and made three appearances for the "Iron".


=== Wrexham ===
After scoring only three goals for Hull in two seasons, Walters was sold to League Two side Wrexham. Upon signing for the cash-strapped club, Walters believed that he made the right choice moving closer to his Merseyside home. He played in 41 matches for the "Dragons" in the 2005–06 season, scoring against Cheltenham Town, Stockport County, Torquay United (twice) and Mansfield Town.


=== Chester City ===
He spent the 2005–06 season at Wrexham before he joined their rivals Chester City in 2006. Walters thrived under the management of Mark Wright and scored ten goals in 33 matches. He impressed in an FA Cup tie against Ipswich Town, prompting Ipswich manager Jim Magilton to make a £100,000 bid for Walters, which was accepted.


=== Ipswich Town ===

Walters agreed terms with Ipswich on a deal worth £100,000 plus add-ons in mid-January 2007, having impressed in FA Cup ties between the clubs earlier in the month. He made his debut for Ipswich on 30 January 2007 in a 0–0 draw at Stoke City. Walters scored his first goal for Ipswich in their 2–1 victory over Queens Park Rangers at Portman Road on 3 March 2007.

On 12 January 2008, he extended his contract with Ipswich until 2011. He had surgery on a niggling knee problem on 19 March 2008 and returned to action against Norwich City on 13 April in half the expected time. Walters played 41 times for Ipswich scoring 13 goals in 2007–08 as the Tractor Boys missed out on a play-off place by just one point. His performances during the season earned him the Player of the Year and Players' Player of the Year awards.The 2008–09 season saw Walters again play 41 matches, scoring seven goals as Ipswich failed to build on last season and finished in 9th position.
The 2009–10 season under the management of Roy Keane saw Ipswich struggle to score goals with Walters top-scoring with only eight and Ipswich finished the season in a poor 15th position. In August 2010, Walters expressed to Roy Keane his desire to leave Portman Road after Stoke City made an offer for him.


=== Stoke City ===

He scored in the next match against Chelsea and was named as Man of the Match. Following the match, Tony Pulis spoke of his delight at Walters' improved performances. "Jon's come from the Championship and sometimes it takes time to have the confidence and the belief to make the step up. He had an up-and-down start but he's been fantastic for us. He's certainly my type of player, he gives everything, he never stops and whatever you've paid him, you know he's earned it."Walters scored twice in Stoke's 5–0 rout over former club Bolton Wanderers in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley to help Stoke into their first FA Cup Final. Walters described it as the pinnacle of his career. Walters ended the 2010–11 season as joint top goalscorer with Kenwyne Jones, both having scored 12 goals. His first goal against Bolton in the semi-final won Goal of the Season. He played in the 2011 FA Cup Final against Manchester City as Stoke lost 1–0.Walters played in his first European match on 28 July against Hajduk Split where he scored the only goal in a 1–0 Stoke win.

In March 2012, Walters won the Sir Stanley Matthews Potteries Footballers of the Year award for 2012.

By 21 April 2012, Walters had played in 50 matches during the 2011–12 campaign and scored nine goals of which five were penalties. This led to Walters being criticised by some Stoke supporters but he was backed by his manager. On his 100th appearance for Stoke, Walters scored twice against his old club Bolton Wanderers in a 2–2 draw, a result which relegated the "Trotters".

Walters continued to be a virtual ever-present in the 2012–13 season as he went on to make a club-record 61 consecutive Premier League starts by 3 November 2012. He scored a well-worked set-piece in a 1–1 draw against West Ham United which earned praise from pundit Gary Neville.

Walters played in every match in the 2012–13 season and was the club's top-scorer with 11 goals. The final game of the season against Southampton was his 89th consecutive league start.Walters made a bad start to the 2013–14 season against Liverpool. After being awarded a last-minute penalty, he saw his shot easily saved by Simon Mignolet and Stoke went on to lose the match 1–0.

This led to him handing in a transfer request but despite this he failed to secure a move away from the club. Walters then scored in back-to-back matches against Leicester City and Bournemouth.
