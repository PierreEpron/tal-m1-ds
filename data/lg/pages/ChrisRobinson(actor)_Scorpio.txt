Chris Robinson (born November 5, 1938) is an American actor, screenwriter, and film director, sometimes credited as Christopher Robinson.


== Career ==
Robinson began his career as an actor in the 1950s. Robinson was a young adult actor and stunt man and appeared in such films of the 1950s as Diary of a High School Bride and Beast from Haunted Cave. In the 1960s, he was cast as flight engineer and top turret gunner Technical Sgt. Alexander "Sandy" Komansky on ABC's Twelve O'Clock High in the last two seasons. In 1972, he got the lead as a fanatical snake charmer in the horror movie, Stanley.
Robinson played Rick Webber #2 on General Hospital from 1978 to 1986, where he was involved in a triangle with his wife Lesley Webber and the married Monica Quartermaine. Following this role, he joined Another World in late 1987, where he played the role of Jason Frame, and was reunited with Denise Alexander, who had played Lesley on General Hospital. Jason was murdered in early 1989. He then appeared on another soap opera, The Bold and the Beautiful as Jack Hamilton, joining in the early 1990s and leaving after three years. He last appeared in this part in 2005, having made several guest appearances over the years. Robinson returned to General Hospital after a 16-year absence in 2002, only to see his character of Rick killed off in a controversial storyline that altered the back story. In 2013, he appeared in a 50th-anniversary celebration episode as Rick's spirit, making peace with his old rival Alan Quartermaine when they both appeared to Monica and Alan's sister, Tracy.
In 1984, Robinson was a spokesman for Vicks Formula 44 cough syrup. The commercials aired on national television, and began with the quote, "I'm not a doctor, but I do play one on TV". Robinson was replaced in the commercial by Peter Bergman after Robinson's legal difficulties.
