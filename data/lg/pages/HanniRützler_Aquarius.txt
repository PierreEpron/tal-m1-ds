Aside from an apprenticeship in person-centered interviewing (completed in 1991), she was an associate at the interdisciplinary research project "Ernährungskultur in Österreich" ("Nutritional Culture in Austria") at the Institut für Kulturstudien (IKUS). Since then, she has been working as a freelance nutritional scientist, a consultant of food & beverage enterprises and a food trends researcher.

=== Cultured meat test ===

On 5 August 2013, Rützler took part in food testing the world's first lab-grown burger, which was cooked and eaten at a news conference in London. Scientists from Maastricht University in the Netherlands, led by professor Mark Post, had taken stem cells from a cow and grown them into strips of muscle which they then combined to make a burger. Tissue for the London demonstration was cultivated in May 2013, using about 20,000 thin strips of cultured muscle tissue. Funding of around  €250,000 came from an anonymous donor later revealed to be Sergey Brin. The burger was cooked by chef Richard McGeown of Couch's Great House Restaurant, Polperro, Cornwall, and tasted by critics Rützler and Josh Schonwald, as well as lead researcher Post. Rützler stated,

There is really a bite to it, there is quite some flavour with the browning. I know there is no fat in it so I didn't really know how juicy it would be, but there is quite some intense taste; it's close to meat, it's not that juicy, but the consistency is perfect.  This is meat to me... It's really something to bite on and I think the look is quite similar.
Rützler added that even in a blind trial she would have taken the product for meat rather than a soya copy.


=== Personal life ===
Rützler is married to cultural scholar, playwright and journalist Wolfgang Reiter and lives in Vienna and Primmersdorf in Lower Austria. She is a flexitarian.
