Robert Joseph Feerick (January 2, 1920 – June 8, 1976) was an American professional basketball player, coach and general manager. He was born in San Francisco, California at the old French Hospital, attended Star of the Sea Catholic school and old Lowell High school.


== Playing career ==
A 6'3" guard from Santa Clara University, Feerick played for the Washington Capitols from 1946 to 1950, the NBA's first four seasons of existence (the league was known as the Basketball Association of America during the first three). Playing under coach Red Auerbach, he was named to the All-NBA first team in 1947 and 1948 after averaging 16.8 (second in the league behind Joe Fulks's 23.1) and 16.1 points per game respectively. In 1949, the league's first season as the newly formed NBA, the Capitols named Feerick player-coach.
In 221 games, he scored 2936 points for an average of 13.3 per game.


== Coaching career ==
After his short professional career, Feerick returned to Santa Clara as head coach of its basketball team from 1950 to 1962. Feerick also was Wilt Chamberlain's personal coach with the San Francisco Warriors during the 1962–63 season. The franchise had just relocated from Philadelphia and hired Feerick, the native San Franciscan, to replace Frank McGuire, who resigned rather than make the move with the team. The Warriors finished 31–49 for their first year in San Francisco after losing to the Boston Celtics in each of the previous three Eastern Division finals. 
The following season, Alex Hannum replaced Feerick as coach.  Feerick later served the Warriors as general manager and director of player personnel.
He was a finalist for the NBA 25th Anniversary Team in 1971. He is one of only two members nominated to the team not in the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame.
