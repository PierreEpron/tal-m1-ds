== Ukraine scandal involvement ==
On October 1, 2019, a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit was issued by American Oversight, an American activist group, against the United States Department of State.  Kenna was named, along with other officials, in connection to the Trumpâ€“Ukraine scandal.  The lawsuit requested communications of various sorts between the named officials and lawyers Rudy Giuliani, Victoria Toensing, and Joseph diGenova, along with communications regarding Ukraine officials and communications regarding Marie Yovanovitch, who was the Ambassador to Ukraine until she was recalled early in May.  In the same week, text messages from former Special Representative for Ukraine, Kurt Volker, were released in a joint statement by the Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and Oversight and Reform Committees.  In the statement was a conversation by acting Ambassador to Ukraine, Bill Taylor, and Ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, over withholding aid to Ukraine.  Sondland redirected Taylor to Kenna over concerns that Taylor held regarding the withholding.
