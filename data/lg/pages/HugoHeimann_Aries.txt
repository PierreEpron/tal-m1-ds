Hugo Heimann (15 April 1859 – 23 February 1951) was a German publisher and Social Democratic politician.


== Biography ==
Heimann was born in Konitz, Prussia (Chojnice, Poland), the son of Eduard (1818–1861) and Marie Heimann. The family moved to Berlin, where he attended the Evangelisches Gymnasium zum Grauen Kloster but left school without passing his Abitur. He started an apprenticeship as a bookseller and worked at Nicholas Trübner publishing house in London from 1880 to 1884. He became Trübner's private secretary and returned to Berlin after Trübner's death. Here, he became a partner of the J. Guttentagsche Verlagsbuchhandlung publishing house and its sole proprietor in 1890. Heimann's publishing house became the official publisher for juridical publications of the Reichsjustizamt, especially  regarding the new nationwide civil law code, the Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch. In 1898, he sold the company, which would become part of Walter de Gruyter in 1919.

In 1899, with a donation of 600,000 goldmarks, he founded the Free Public library in Berlin-Kreuzberg. Initially stocked with 7,000 books it soon reached a number of 20,000 volumes and 540 newspapers and magazines. The first floor of the library housed the official archives of the Social Democratic Party, about 8000 printed and numerous handwritten documents. The archive included the private library of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, which was systematized under the supervision of Max Schippel. While the bulk of the official archive was moved to the SPD's headquarter in November 1904, 443 books remained at Heimann's library, including a large number of books of Marx and Engels' provenance.Following World War I Heimann gifted the library to the City of Berlin in 1919 which renamed the library "Hugo Heimannsche Bücherei und Lesehalle" in 1920. Since opening it had attracted 2.5 million visitors.In 1901 he financed the construction of a row of eight small houses, the Red Houses at Prinzenallee 46, Gesundbrunnen. The property was transferred to several Social Democratic politicians like Karl Liebknecht, Eduard Bernstein and Paul Singer, which, as private real estate was a binding premise for passive electoral rights, allowed them to be elected to the City council.
