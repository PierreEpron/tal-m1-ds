Richard England (born Richard England Sant Fournier on 3 October 1937) is a Maltese architect, writer, artist and academic.


== Biography ==

Son of Edwin England Sant Fournier and Ina Desain, Richard studied at St. Edward's College, and later graduated in Architecture at the University of Malta.  He then continued his studies in Italy at the Polytechnic University of Milan and also worked as a student-architect in the studio of the Italian architect-designer in Gio Ponti in 1960-62.He is also a sculptor, photographer, poet, artist and author of a number of books. He is a Visiting Professor at the University of Malta, having acted as Dean of the Faculty of Architecture between 1987 and 1989.  He is also an Hon. Fellow at the University of Bath in the UK, and an Academician and Vice-President of the International Academy of Architecture.England has lectured and exhibited his work in North and South America, the UK, Europe, the Middle and as far East as Russia. During the 1970s he worked in Saudi Arabia while in the early 80s he was appointed, together with Robert Venturi, Arup Associates, Arthur Erickson, Sheppard Robson and Ricardo Bofill as a consultant to the Mayoralty of Baghdad, Iraq to work on the rehabilitation of the city under the Mayoralty's architect Rifat Chadirji.His philosophy centers on an expression referred to by Charles Knevitt as "a valid, contemporary regionalism", preferring a process of evolution as opposed to revolution, “a new leaf as opposed to a new tree”, believing that architecture should be appropriate to both place and time and that it should evoke the spirit of the place.Richard England has lectured and worked in the capacity of Architectural Consultant to governmental and private institutions in the following countries: US, UK, Yugoslavia, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Italy, Argentina, Poland, Bulgaria, Russia, Kazakhstan and his native Malta.He married Myriam Borg Manduca in 1962 and has one daughter and one son.

=== Critical response ===
“Richard England’s restless mind and nervous energy find expression in so many different artistic fields that it leaves one breathless”.“His architecture intense, sunny, rich in pure forms, bejewelled with bright colours …works designed with imagination, ingenuity and indisputable, creative passion”.“A style of his own, successfully relating to the elements of the island’s tradition. Malta is fortunate to have him to lead the profession on the island”.“The Garden of Apollo …a real coup de grace where the architect’s imagination, artistic myths and cultural realities merge to provide a fitting reminder of this architect’s amazing talents”.“Richard England played an active part in building up the Malta tourist industry designing a series of resort hotels which set a new standard for the type”.
