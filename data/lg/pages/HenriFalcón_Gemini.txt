In 1987 he married Marielba Díaz, with whom he had four children. In 1992 he began his graduate studies in political science at Simón Bolívar University.

=== Governor of Lara State ===
Falcón was elected governor of Lara State in 2008, as a candidate of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV), with 73.15% of the votes.As governor Falcón did not support the 2009 Venezuelan Constitutional Referendum, which was ultimately supported by the Venezuelan electorate.
He was re-elected in 2012, as a candidate of the Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD) opposition coalition, with 54.35% of the votes.


=== Party switch ===
In 2007, Movimiento V República (MVR, "Fifth Republic Movement"), of which Falcón was a member, was transformed into the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV). On 21 February 2010 Governor Falcón gave a letter to President Hugo Chávez declaring his resignation from the PSUV to join the more independent pro-government party Patria Para Todos (PPT, "Fatherland for All"), and to become a member of the latter party's national directorate. Falcón declared that "The relation between a Head of state and the governors and mayors cannot be limited to the emission of instructions or orders without the minimum opportunity that we can confront points of view, to analyze the pros and the cons of your determined initiatives and to revise or to revoke decisions that, after their execution, turn out to be harmful or objections to the interest of the region or of the country".In June 2012, Falcón announced the creation of a new political party, Progressive Advance, that was aligned with the opposition coalition (known as MUD), and thus supported the candidacy of Henrique Capriles against incumbent President Hugo Chávez in the 2012 Venezuelan presidential election.In January 2018, Falcón announced he will be running for president, as a candidate of the Progressive Advance party, in the upcoming Venezuelan snap election scheduled for 30 April 2018 but was delayed to 20 May 2018.


== Political views ==


=== Domestic ===
Falcón has stated that he was once a Chavista, though he separated from the movement when he began to disagree with its direction. When Falcón left PSUV in 2010, he criticized the party believing there was a lack of space between Hugo Chávez and Venezuelan officials, stating "The relationship between a head of state and governors and mayors cannot simply issuing instructions or orders without the slightest chance that we can confront points of view, analyze the pros and cons of certain initiatives and to revise or revoke decisions after their execution, are harmful or inconvenience to the interest of the region or the country". He also believed that PSUV was "undermined by bureaucracy, lack of discussion, patronage, groupism, and a poorly understood concept of loyalty". Falcón was also criticized at the time for meeting with opposition students who protested against the Venezuelan government.One of three opposition governors, Falcón, citing the danger of civil unrest, called for dialogue rather than confrontation with the Maduro government in June 2015. Falcón stated that Venezuela's governmental model was "finished" though he cautioned a "jump from one extreme to another". Falcón's ideas and his experience with both the Bolivarian government and the opposition was noted by Reuters which stated Falcón would "be a central figure" of a transitional government in Venezuela.


=== International ===
Falcon has disagreed with the mainstream opposition approach. In March 2015, U.S. President Obama issued an executive order declaring Venezuela a national security threat and imposing sanctions on seven Venezuelan officials accused of human rights abuses; Falcón described the order as "threatening," "interventionist and unfriendly", saying the tone was "disrespectful" not just to the government but to all Venezuelans. He said he regarded the sanctions as an intrusion into the internal affairs of the country, as well as a disservice to Venezuela's political opposition.
