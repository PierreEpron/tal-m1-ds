=== Genoa ===
Genoa signed Santos for €900,000 in co-ownership deal in August 2007; AlbinoLeffe also re-signed Filippo Carobbio from Genoa in June for €200,000, thus Santos' deal only involved €700,000 cash. Santos picked no.33 shirt. However, after a season he was sold to Reggina. Santos only made 11 starts in 2007–08 Serie A, as the team had centre-backs likes Cesare Bovo and Alessandro Lucarelli in its 3–4–3 or 4–3–3 formation.

The coach rested Lucarelli and did not put Bega into the bench (who suspended in round 15). Santos also played the next match (round 17), as Bovo was suspended. He formed the 3-men defense with Andrea Masiello and De Rosa, winning Parma 1–0. However, from round 14 to 38 (25 in total) Santos only started 10 times, and the coach later even used 4-men defense with Domenico Criscito as emergency centre-back instead of using neither Santos nor De Rosa.

In July 2008 Santos signed with Reggina for €1 million from Genoa, made Santos was co-contracted between Genoa and Reggina. Genoa paid AlbinoLeffe €250,000 cash and Francesco Renzetti who tagged for €750,000 in order to acquire the 50% registration rights of Santos, but Renzetti was in fact acquired from Lucchese for €600,000 only, made Genoa instantly had a €150,000 profit. Reggina did not need to pay Genoa cash in the deal however, as Genoa also acquired Giandomenico Mesto (50% for €3.5 million) and Francesco Modesto (€5 million) from Reggina.Santos wore no.33 shirt in 2008–09 Serie A and in 2009–10 Serie B.Santos injured his achilles tendon in May 2009. In June 2009 Genoa re-acquired Renzetti for €250,000 and the remain 50% rights of Mesto for €3 million, while Santos' deal was renewed. The deal made AlbinoLeffe received €500,000 cash in total for Santos; as Santos' 50% rights actually worth €500,000 cash (instead of €1M), Reggina made a €500,000 discount for Mesto, but de facto unchanged.
