Jamal Julian Campbell-Ryce (born 6 April 1983) is a former professional footballer who played as a winger. He is currently with Peterborough United as Manager of the U18s.
Born in Lambeth, Greater London he began his career with Charlton Athletic in 2001 from where he has moved to a number of clubs including Rotherham United, Southend United, Barnsley, Bristol City and Notts County before joining Sheffield United in 2014.

== Career ==
Campbell-Ryce played a handful of games for Southend United in the 05/06 season during a loan deal from Rotherham United. However, the deal turned sour, and left him in the limbo so Rotherham recalled him and sent him to Colchester United to get some first team football. The tricky winger has also played for Charlton Athletic, Chesterfield (where he scored once in the Football League Trophy against Macclesfield), Wimbledon , Colchester and Leyton Orient.
Campbell-Ryce joined Southend in the summer of 2006 after a deal was agreed between Southend and Rotherham. As both Southend and Colchester were promoted to the Championship at the end of the 2005–06 season, and Campbell-Ryce had played for both clubs during the season, he had the unusual privilege of touring both towns on open-top bus victory parades on successive days.


=== Barnsley ===
In early August in 2007, Southend rejected a £250,000 bid from Barnsley for Campbell-Ryce, though he finally completed his move to Barnsley on the deadline day for an undisclosed fee.

On 26 January 2008, Campbell-Ryce scored the winner in Barnsley's 1–0 away win against his former club Southend in the fourth round of the FA Cup.In October, Campbell-Ryce signed a new three-year deal at Oakwell, keeping him with Barnsley until the summer of 2011.In February 2009, he scored at Hillsborough to sink Sheffield Wednesday and complete the first double over the Owls for 63 years and the Reds' first win there since 1983. On 3 May 2009 he scored the winner in a 2–1 win over Plymouth Argyle, a result which kept the club in the Championship.


=== Bristol City ===
On 19 January 2010, Campbell-Ryce signed a two-and-a-half-year deal with fellow Championship club Bristol City for an undisclosed fee. He made his debut in a 0–6 loss against Cardiff City on 26 January. Manager Keith Millen often used Campbell-Ryce as a wingback in his 3–5–2 formation. He scored his first goal for the club in the 3–0 win over Cardiff City, just under a year after signing. Campbell-Ryce established himself in the first team, playing regularly until Millen was replaced by Derek McInnes. Under McInnes' management, Campbell-Ryce started only two first-team games.
