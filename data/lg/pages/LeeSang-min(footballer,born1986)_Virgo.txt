He began his senior career in one the top clubs in Brazil, the Coritiba Football Club. He made his debut at the age of 17 years old. His style of playing has been compared to PSG Brazilian midfielder Lucas Moura, with commentators praising strong, fast, technical skill with both legs.
He came back to Korea in 2008. Gyeongnam FC manager Cho Kwang-Rae wanted to contract with him, and the bid was successfully completed. Lee joined Gyeongnam FC with a new foreign player Almir and was given the number 30. He was evaluated and found to be a very good technician and hot-prospect player by his manager and coaches. He left the club in 2010 but returned four years later. As of 2017, he is not listed on any Club rosters.
