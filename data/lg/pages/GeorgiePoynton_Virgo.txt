==== 2017 – Bohemians Loan ====
2017 was the first season Poynton was finished up playing Under 19's football with Dundalk alongside senior football and with Dundalk chasing their fourth league title in a row, they opted to send Poynton out on loan in order to get game time at first team level.

He made 27 appearances for Bohs, scoring 5 goals in his first full season as a senior player.


==== 2018 season ====
Poynton returned to Dundalk for the 2018 season, signing a new contract with the club on 8 January 2018. 2018 proved to be a difficult one for Poynton as he struggled to break into the starting eleven ahead of Robbie Benson, Stephen O'Donnell and Chris Shields.

Poynton was a mainstay in the Waterford team that season, playing 32 of their 36 league matches as they finished 6th.
