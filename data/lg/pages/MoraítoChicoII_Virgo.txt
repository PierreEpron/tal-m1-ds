Moraíto Chico (born Manuel Moreno Junquera; 13 September 1956 – 10 August 2011) was a Flamenco guitarist.He was known as one of the best and most in-demand accompanying guitarists of his generation, and regularly accompanied José Mercé, Diego Carrasco and other popular flamenco singers. He also performed often with such stars as La Paquera de Jerez, Camarón de la Isla and Manuel Agujetas. Moraito was particularly renowned for his powerful, full, and round sound, his driving rhythmic style and impressive rasgueos. He was one of the finest exponents of the buleria form and can be seen and heard playing in this style on Carlos Saura's influential 'Flamenco' and "Flamenco, Flamenco' films.
Moraito was the nephew of the original Moraíto (Manuel Moreno a.k.a. Manuel Morao), and son of the original Moraíto Chico (Juan Moreno). His son, Diego Del Morao, is one of the best known of the current generation of Flamenco guitarists.
He died on 10 August 2011, after a long struggle with cancer.
