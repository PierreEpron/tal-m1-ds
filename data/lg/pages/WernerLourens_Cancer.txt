== Career ==


=== Youth and Varsity Rugby ===
Lourens joined the Blue Bulls academy and was a member of the Blue Bulls U19 squad that participated in the 2009 Under-19 Provincial Championship.
Since 2010, he played club rugby for the Tshwane University of Technology's rugby team, the TUT Vikings. He made five appearances for them during the 2010 Varsity Cup competition and also participated in the Carlton League.
In 2012, he was a member of the Griffons' wider training group, but (despite interest from the Welkom-based outfit to sign him permanently) decided to play in the 2013 Varsity Shield instead, where he started six matches for TUT, scoring one try against UFH Blues.


=== Griffons ===
He did eventually join the Griffons for 2014 and was included in their squad for the 2014 Vodacom Cup. He made his first class debut for the Griffons in their match against Griquas in Kimberley, ending on the losing side of a 20–12 scoreline. He made three more starts during the competition as the Griffons finished sixth in their group. He made a further four appearances for the Griffons during the 2014 Currie Cup qualification series as they finished third to remain in the 2014 Currie Cup First Division competition.


=== Free State Cheetahs ===
An injury crisis for the Free State Cheetahs during the 2014 Currie Cup Premier Division saw Lourens make a short-term move to Bloemfontein. He made his debut in the Premier Division of the Currie Cup in the Cheetahs' match against the Pumas, which they lost 17–31, but was an unused substitute in their next match against the Sharks.
