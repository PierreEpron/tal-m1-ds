== Career ==
Carfrae competed in her first triathlon in 2000, at the age of 19. She went on to represent Australia at the Junior and U23 level, winning a silver medal at the 2003 ITU U23 World Championships. In 2004, she won a silver medal at the Salford Triathlon leg of the ITU Triathlon World Cup. She was an Australian Institute of Sport scholarship holder.


=== Long distance ===
Carfrae's first attempt at longer distances was at the Lake Tinaroo Half Ironman in September 2002, where she finished in second place behind Rebekah Keat, setting a new run course record of 1:21:20. Referring to this race, she later wrote, "I just remember feeling more comfortable racing the longer distance, and from then I knew I would be racing full Ironman at some point in future."Carfrae achieved her first World Championship medal at the 2005 ITU Long Distance World Championships, where she finished 2nd in a time of 6:27:11. In 2007, she won the Ironman 70.3 World Championships in a course record time of 4:07:25. This win entitled Carfrae to race at the full Ironman World Championships at Kona, but she deferred her entry to 2009, when she felt she was ready for the longer distance. At the 2009 Ironman World Championship, Carfrae's first Ironman race, she finished second behind Chrissie Wellington, breaking Wellington's 2008 course record for the women's marathon with a time of 2:56:51. She wrote, "My first tri was at the end of 1999—my first Ironman was 10 years later. I waited until I felt I was physically and mentally strong enough to go the distance, and until I could be seriously competitive."Carfrae set a course record at the Ironman World Championship at Kona, Hawaii in 2013 with a time of 8:52:14.  Additionally, at that race she set a women's record time for the run portion of the course at 2:50:38. In 2015, she started the Ironman World Championship race at Kona, but withdrew from the bike leg due to pain from injuries sustained in a collision with a car earlier that week.
