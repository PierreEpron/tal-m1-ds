In 2021, Jones's mother was diagnosed with motor neurone disease. On 23 September, Bolton Wanderers (Jones' team at the time) announced the first team would play a friendly against a team consisting of legendary Bolton players on 13 November to help raise money for his mother's recovery. A quarter of the money raised would also go to former Bolton player Stephen Darby's charity Darby Rimmer MND Foundation, as he had also suffered from Motor Neurone Disease which had forced him to retire. His mother died on 2 March 2022. A year later, he revealed that her death nearly caused him retire but that the support he received from the fans and staff at Bolton helped him through it.
