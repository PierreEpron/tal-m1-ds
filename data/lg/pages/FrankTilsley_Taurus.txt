Tilsley was born in Lancashire and grew up in Manchester, where he was educated at Chapel Street Council School, Levenshulme. He worked in a variety of fields, including as an accountant's clerk and a schoolteacher. His first novel, Plebeian's Progress (1933), was met warmly by critics and was "highly valued for the authenticity of its critical depiction of working-class conditions in a period of economic depression." Following the success of his debut novel, Tilsley was able to write full-time. He continued writing until his death in 1957, publishing over twenty novels. During World War II, he served in the RAF as a war reporter, and was given the rank of Squadron Leader. After the war, Tilsley joined the BBC, where he wrote for both radio and television.
