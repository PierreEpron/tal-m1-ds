In August 1994, she came to White's support after a Circuit Court judge ruled that she failed to adequately represent a woman charged with conspiring to murder her parents.

In 2000, Lawlah refused to endorse a referendum to abolish term limits for the county executive and county council of Prince George's County. In November of that year, voters rejected a referendum by a 2-to-1 margin.
