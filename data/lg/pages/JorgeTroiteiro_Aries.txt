At the end of his 18-month spell, he went back to his adopted home and joined Mérida UD in 2003. He never played any higher than Segunda División B, where he made 223 appearances and scored 21 goals for eight clubs, suffering four relegations including three in consecutive seasons. Abroad, he played for Doxa Katokopias FC and Enosis Neon Paralimni FC in Cyprus; the former was his career's only professional output, in the 2012–13 First Division.
