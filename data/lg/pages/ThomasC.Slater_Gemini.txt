The year prior, he cast the role vote against an amendment to name the medicinal marijuana law after him. The Edward O. Hawkins and Thomas C. Slater Medical Marijuana Act passed in 2006, but did not clarify legal methods for patients to procure their medicine, leaving them dependent on the black market.
