Standing six feet one inch tall, he was also a good fieldsman.Smith was a schoolteacher who played most of his cricket during the summer school holidays. In 1958 A. A. Thomson said of him: "Ernest was one of that devoted band of August schoolmasters – happily they survive to-day – who pack their boys off home and add a kind of academic gaiety to the month's cricket." He added that Smith could "defend like a lowered portcullis if Yorkshire were in serious trouble" or bat "like a charging cavalry leader".Smith died in April 1945 in Eastbourne, Sussex. His brother, A. E. Smith, played one first-class game for the "English Residents" in Philadelphia in 1890.
