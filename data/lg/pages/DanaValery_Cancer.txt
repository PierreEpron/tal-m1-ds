== Discography ==
Valery's first USA album was an RCA collaboration album with Al Hirt and Boots Randolph titled Horns Of Plenty. Valery recorded a version of the Paul Simon song "You Don't Know Where Your Interest Lies" and released it as a single in January 1967, well before Simon & Garfunkel released their version in July 1967 as the B-side to "Fakin' It".  Valery's version became a massive song on the Northern Soul scene, having been a popular spin at Wigan Casino.
Her solo debut album in the United States was called  Not The Flower, But The Root on the Brunswick label in 1972. The Not The Flower But The Root album has been reissued on CD in Japan with one bonus track. Her follow up was Dana Valery in 1975. The cover artwork shows her wearing black against a black background, resulting in a cameo-like effect. This album can still be found on Internet record stores and auction sites. This album was issued on RCA's custom label – Phantom and was produced by Leslie West of Mountain. She recorded ten LP albums, two EPs, and a number of singles in South Africa prior to going abroad. In Johannesburg, Dana won two SARIE awards in (1964 and 1965) for Best Female Vocalist.
