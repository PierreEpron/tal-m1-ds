Howard W. Mattson (May 15, 1927 â€“ May 21, 1998) was the third Executive Vice President of the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT), serving in that capacity from 1987 until his 1991 retirement. Prior to that, he had served in public relations and later became an advocate of organ transplant after his 1991 IFT retirement.

A native of Duluth, Minnesota, Mattson earned his B.S. in 1949 at the University of Michigan. After graduation, he worked as a chemist for Allied Chemical Company, then he shifted his focus to public relations.

Mattson first started his career in public relations as an assistant advertising manager for the Bristol Company, then went to work for Bell Telephone Laboratories as editor and technical information supervisor.

Upon Willey's retirement in 1987, Mattson would be promoted to Executive Director. He would hold that position until the 1991 Annual Meeting in Dallas, Texas when he suffered a heart attack. The attack would force Mattson to retire and undergo a heart transplant.
