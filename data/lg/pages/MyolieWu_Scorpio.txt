=== Acting ===
In her early years, Myolie Wu started out as supporting characters in television serials. Her acting began to gain recognition through her breakthrough performance in Golden Faith, in which she portrayed the mentally challenged younger sister of Gallen Lo. Her role was well received by the audience and she was awarded the Most Improved Female Artiste Award at the 2002 TVB Anniversary Awards.Wu was offered her first lead role in Survivor's Law in 2003. In the same year, she also starred in the classic TVB drama Triumph in the Skies alongside veteran actors Francis Ng and Flora Chan. Both series received high viewership ratings and she soon rose to popularity.
In 2005, TVB aired five drama serials in which Wu was lead actress. She received further acknowledgement for her acting in the hit series Wars of In-Laws where she played the shrewd daughter in-law of Liza Wang. The same serial was also what sparked her ongoing rumours with co-star Bosco Wong.In 2007, Wu was paired with Mainland actor Feng Shao Feng in the TVB-CCTV joint production The Drive Of Life. The couple was well received by fans. She also starred as Chow Lai-Man in the second installment of War of In-Laws, Wars of In-Laws II in the same year.

Wu took another step in her acting career in 2009 by filming her first Mainland drama Beauty's Rival in Palace, in which she guest-starred in for five episodes and was once again paired with Feng Shao Feng. The drama achieved a high viewership rating and her performance was well-praised. She continued to film her second Mainland series Happy Mother-in-Law, Pretty Daughter-in-Law as lead actress the same year and gained widespread popularity in Mainland China.
She also filmed her third Mainland drama Racecourse alongside boyfriend Bosco Wong in late 2010. The series was their third collaboration portraying a couple.
In 2011, Wu starred in TVB dramas The Rippling Blossom, Ghetto Justice, and Curse of the Royal Harem and all three series were listed as Top 5 in viewership ratings of the year. She was crowned "TV Queen" at the 2011 TVB Anniversary Awards after being awarded Best Actress in a Leading Role for her role in Curse of the Royal Harem and My Favorite Female Character for her role in Ghetto Justice. She was also voted by the audience as the Most Extraordinary Elegant Actress (Bosco Wong won the male equivalent) during the awards, making her the first ever TVB actress to win 3 awards at the same award ceremony. By the summer of 2015, after 16 years with TVB, Wu decided not to renew her contract with TVB to explore new prospects. Despite former TVB actors heavily critical of TVB's treatment towards their stars, she only offered her gratitude and bid farewell to the station. With the support of her fellow TVB actresses, Wu opened a bridal studio business as part of her venture into business.
