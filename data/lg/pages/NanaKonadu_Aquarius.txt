Nana Yaw Konadu Yeboah (born February 15, 1964) is a Ghanaian former professional boxer who competed from 1985 to 2001. He is a world champion in two weight classes, having held the WBC super-flyweight title from 1989 to 1990, and the WBA bantamweight title twice between 1996 and 1998.


== Professional career ==
Konadu made his professional debut on May 5, 1985. In his 15th professional bout, he defeated former champion Cesar Polanco to capture the WBC International super flyweight title.


=== WBC super-flyweight Title ===
On November 7, 1989, Konadu captured the WBC and Lineal Super Flyweight Title with a decision win over two-time champion Gilberto Roman. He lost the belt in his first defense to Sung Kil Moon by technical decision. The fight was a war with both fighters exchanging knockdowns, however, the action was stopped in the ninth round due to a headbutt and Moon was declared the winner on the scorecards. He lost a rematch to Moon in 1991 by knockout.


=== WBA bantamweight title ===
Konadu scored 15 consecutive victories over the next four years, including wins over Juan Polo Perez, former champion Victor Rabanales, and Abraham Torres.  On January 28, 1996, he became a two-division champion by capturing the WBA Bantamweight Title in a TKO victory over Veeraphol Sahaprom, who would go on to become a long-reigning champion.  He again lost the belt in his first defense to Daorung Chuvatana by a technical decision but recaptured the belt the following year in a rematch.  He defended the belt once before losing it to Johnny Tapia in 1998.  He rebounded with a win over former champion Hector Acero Sanchez and retired in 2001 after being TKO'd by Daniel Seda.  He now lives with his family in New Dormaa, Sunyani, Ghana.
