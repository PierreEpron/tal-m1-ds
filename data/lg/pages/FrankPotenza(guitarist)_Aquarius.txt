Frank Potenza (born February 10, 1950) is an American jazz guitarist.


== Early life ==
A native of Providence, Rhode Island, Potenza started playing his sister Norma's acoustic guitar. At age 12, he was influenced by his cousin, Jimmy Gagliardi, who "played and sang in rock and roll shows and nightclubs", drove a convertible, smoked Lucky Strikes, and was "the epitome of cool". Gagliardi taught Potenza guitar parts from the R&B songs of the day, especially Duane Eddy and Bill Doggett tunes. He was exposed to jazz via his father's record collection, but by his early teens, Potenza was more interested in the electric guitar sounds of rock and roll.By the early 70s, Potenza returned to jazz after hearing George Benson. This led him to other jazz guitarists, such as Pat Martino and Wes Montgomery. After high school, he attended the Berklee College of Music in Boston, graduating in 1972 with a bachelor's degree in music.

In 1974, Potenza took his father to see Joe Pass perform at the Jazz Workshop in Boston. Potenza was a fan of Pass's albums Intercontinental, Virtuoso, and The Trio. After the concert, Potenza made his way to Pass's dressing room, shook his hand, and asked if he was giving lessons while in town. According to Potenza, "I had my first lesson with him the very next day, and that was the beginning of a 20-year friendship with him. It was a great blessing to be able to spend as much time as I got to spend with Joe." Their friendship lasted until May 1994, when Pass succumbed to liver cancer.
