I was discovered by Rise through Ma'am Charo, she was the one who discovered me. She saw one of my videos where I sang 'We've Only Just Begun', where I was in a green dress.

When she was asked about using a screen name in place of her real name, she said,

Yes, the management [decided on the name change]. But, the agreement was with both sides, so we decided to change the name.
