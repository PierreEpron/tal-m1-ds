Arriving as a Prime League player to Singaporean club Balestier Khalsa in June 2009, Pitt scored his second goal for the Tigers in a 5–1 loss to Super Reds FC, with his first in a 2–1 win over Young Lions. Released from Balestier in December that year along with all their foreign players, the Singaporean media proliferated rumors that he was trialling with local team Young Lions but the mover never happened.
