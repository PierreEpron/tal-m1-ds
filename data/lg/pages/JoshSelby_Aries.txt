=== Controversy ===
After choosing to attend Kansas, a report said Selby had not yet been cleared to play by the NCAA. According to this report, the NCAA had been investigating for months the relationship between Selby and Robert "Bay" Frazier, the business manager for New York Knicks star Carmelo Anthony. Selby had acknowledged a friendship with Anthony in past interviews and spoke of his contact with Frazier in an April story in The New York Times. All three are Baltimore natives. Maeshon Witherspoon, Selby's mother, told The Times that she had known Bay since elementary school and had asked him to serve as an adviser during his college recruitment. The Times report said Witherspoon asked Frazier to host Selby's in-home visits with college coaches at his own home and that Frazier attended a KU–Missouri game at Allen Fieldhouse in January 2009.
On November 21, 2010, the NCAA made its final ruling on the matter, suspending Selby for nine games and ordering him to pay $4,607.58, the total of the "improper benefits" received from Frazier, to the charity of his choice.NBA teams were reluctant to draft Selby due to a perceived selfish style of play and negative attitude off the court.
