Upon joining the Arizona League Mariners of the Rookie-level Arizona League, he was able to throw as fast as 93 miles per hour (150 km/h), with the team expecting that he would increase his velocity by approximately 2 to 3 miles per hour (3.2–4.8 km/h) by adding 20 to 30 pounds (9.1–13.6 kg). By 2011, Maurer could throw as hard as 96 miles per hour (154 km/h).In 2009, Maurer pitched for the Pulaski Mariners of the Rookie-level Appalachian League.

After the season, Maurer was added to the Mariners' 40-man roster to be protected from the Rule 5 Draft.In spring training in 2013, Maurer competed with Erasmo Ramírez, Jeremy Bonderman, and Blake Beavan for one of the final two spots in the Mariners' five-man starting rotation, behind Félix Hernández, Hisashi Iwakuma, and Joe Saunders.  Allowing only two runs in 20 innings with 22 strikeouts and six walks in the Cactus League, Maurer made the Mariners' 25-man roster as a starting pitcher, skipping the Class AAA level. Maurer became the first member of the Mariners' 2008 draft class to reach the major leagues and the first starting pitcher to skip Class AAA and debut for the Mariners since John Cummings and Mike Hampton in 1993.
