== Mayoralty ==
Dyster became a city councilman in 2000 under Mayor Irene Elia. He then gave up his council seat after one term to run for mayor and was one of four Democratic candidates, who were Dyster, Niagara County Legislator Sam Granieri, Niagara Falls Water Board employee Glenn Choolokian, and City Councilman Vince Anello. Anello won the primary narrowly and went on to win in a landslide against then-Mayor Irene Elia, who was running for a second term.
In the Democratic Primary in September 2007, Dyster won by a narrow margin over Councilman Lewis Rotella, who was considered the favorite to win the primary. Then-Mayor Anello could not run for reelection due to his violation of state election law by having volunteers who were not in his political party nor registered to vote pass out petitions. Anello went on to be indicted on charges of conspiracy, obstruction of justice and scheme to defraud and was sentenced to federal prison in January 2011 for a separate charge of filing false documents.
