'The bank for the individual' is the motto of the new institution."In December 1924, Bigelow changed the name of his bank to the Eastern Exchange Bank and continued to serve as its president.  In November 1926, W. A. Harriman & Co., Inc., purchased "a substantial interest" in the bank, with Bigelow remaining as the president.  At the time of the Harriman investment, The New York Times described the business of Bigelow's bank as follows: "This bank is said to be the only institution in New York City confining its activities entirely to individual deposit accounts, and makes a point of extending banking facilities to small accounts.  It does no commercial business and discounts no commercial paper, confining its loans only to marketable collateral."  In May 1928, the Eastern Exchange Bank moved its headquarters from 10 Broadway to the Harriman Building at 37 Broadway.
