=== Fiction ===
Varese's debut novel, The Spirit Photographer (2018), is loosely based on the 19th-century American spirit photographer, William Mumler. Varese drew from Mumler's biography to create an independent novel about a protagonist who was a photographer in Boston after having worked with Mathew Brady during the Civil War to photograph the dead.
One day the photographer sees the face of an African-American woman he knew, who appears as a spirit in a glass-plate photograph of a couple seeking contact with their son who died young. The novel takes place during the Reconstruction era in U.S. history, exploring issues of northern and southern racism in post-Civil War America, and the role of spiritualism in dealing with the widespread grief due to losses during the war. Varese has said that the novel's story was influenced by the work of civil rights activists Bryan Stevenson and Michelle Alexander, who have emphasized the connection between slavery and racial injustice in the US since then.The Times Literary Supplement said there was not "a dud word in this extraordinary debut novel," and compared Varese's writing to that of Wilkie Collins and Joseph Conrad. Booklist described the novel as "an addicting tale." Chronogram Magazine wrote that it was an ambitious, sprawling debut, "teeming with spirits, secrets, and trauma." PopMatters said that The Spirit Photographer was "atmospheric, lyrical, and poignant", and that it "deftly interweaves strands of history and fantasy."Varese's second novel, The Company, is set to be published by John Murray in March 2023. The novel is said to be a ghostly thriller based on the true story of arsenic-laced wallpaper in the 19th century.


=== Nonfiction and literary criticism ===
