== Club career ==
After starting out at his hometown club Sloga Doboj and later playing for Borac Banja Luka, Šarić moved to FR Yugoslavia and joined Crvena zvezda. He spent three seasons at the club and won two consecutive national championships (1997 and 1998). In 1999, Šarić switched to ambitious Sintelon, alongside his teammate Ratko Nikolić.
In 2003, Šarić moved to Spain and signed with Ciudad Real, but never played for the team. He instead spent the entire duration of his contract on loan with Cantabria and Alcobendas. In 2006, Šarić was acquired by Ademar León. He also played for Portland San Antonio. In 2009, Šarić agreed terms with Barcelona. He spent seven seasons at the club and won numerous trophies, including two EHF Champions League titles (2011 and 2015).

He was later named in the preliminary squad for the 2000 Summer Olympics, but was omitted from the final selection. Later on, Šarić participated at the 2005 World Championship and 2006 European Championship. He announced his retirement from the national team in February 2006.

In October 2009, it was reported that Šarić accepted a call-up to represent his native Bosnia and Herzegovina.

His last cap came on 12 March 2011 in a 23–21 home loss to Estonia.
