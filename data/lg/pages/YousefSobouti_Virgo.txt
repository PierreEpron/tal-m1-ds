Yousef Sobouti (Persian: یوسف ثبوتی, born 23 August 1932 in Zanjan, Iran) is a contemporary Iranian astrophysicist, theoretical physicist.


== Biography ==
He got his undergraduate degree from Tehran University. In 1960 he received his MSc degree in physics from University of Toronto.
He finished his doctoral thesis on Astronomy and Astrophysics at University of Chicago under the supervision of Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar in 1963.
He started teaching physics in Sharif University of Technology, and Shiraz University. Sobouti made significant contributions to the education of physics and basic sciences in Iran. His aim was to train young scientists who were capable of performing world- class research.
He is the founder of Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences (IASBS), Currently known as the University of Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences. He remained director until Aug 2010 when he was dismissed by the cabinet Minister of Science, Research and Technology.
Many academics and students as well as many distinguished individuals in the city of Zanjan reflected their disappointment with the ministry on this decision. The Parliament representatives complained to the minister on this particular case.
He was one of the people who changed the old educational system (known as Dar ul Funun) to term system.
