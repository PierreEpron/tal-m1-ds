Roy Chowdhury belongs to the Senia Bangash gharana of sarod playing, and who has also been specially trained in the musical tradition of the Jaipur-Atrauli gharana.Roy Chowdhury was born on 12 January 1956, in Deoghar in Jharkhand state. He was initiated into music by his father Shri Ranjit Roy Chowdhury, a teacher of chemistry by profession, but more importantly, a serious Sarod player who had trained under the late Ustad Hafiz Ali Khan and others. In 1978, Roy Chowdhury's talents were spotted by the Maestro Ustad Amjad Ali Khan accepting him as a disciple.
