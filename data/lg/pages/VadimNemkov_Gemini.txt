== Background ==
Vadim was born on June 20, 1992. Many sources contain information that he is a native of Belgorod, but this is not at all the case. His family began their life journey in a small village in Kazakhstan, where they lived until 1999, after which he, his brother Viktor and his parents moved to the village of Tomarovka, Belgorod Region. It was here that Nemkov's sports path began.In all endeavors, Vadim followed his older brother Viktor. At the Tamarov school, they began to attend the judo section, then hand-to-hand combat attracted their attention, and only after that it was the turn of sambo, where both brothers reached great heights and received a good sports base. During the period of study at the school, Nemkov managed to participate in many competitions in sambo and other disciplines. Almost all of his youth was spent at a high pace, learning, discovering new things in sports.At the time of graduation, Vadim was drafted into the army. He himself admits that there was an opportunity not to go there, but there was not even a thought about it. Due to the fact that the guy himself was strong and well physically developed, he was called up for service in the special forces. Nemkov notes that the army gave him additional knowledge, both in the sports component and in life in general. The hardening he received there helps him to enter the cage against any opponent without any fear.At the moment, Vadim has 2 educations. He received the first at the Technological University of Belgorod, having received a diploma in the specialty "Personnel Management", and the second, already in 2017, at BelSU, with a degree in "Coach".During this entire period of time "army-training", Nemkov actively participated in the Russian, European and world championships in combat sambo, where in most cases he took gold. Between 2014 and 2019, he took the gold 4 times at the World Sambo Championships 100 kg class, and after that he said that he would not waste his time on such competitions in the future and would devote himself entirely to MMA.
