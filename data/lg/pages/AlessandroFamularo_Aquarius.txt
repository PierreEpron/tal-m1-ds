== Career ==


=== Karting ===
Famularo started karting in his native Venezuela at the age of four years old. He was a factory driver for the Birel ART team in 2017 and 2018.


=== Formula 4 ===
Famularo began his racing career in 2018, racing for Bhaitech in the Italian F4 Championship. He was a lower-midfield runner for most of the season, his only points finishes coming in the last two rounds at Vallelunga and Mugello.
In 2019 he switched to reigning teams' champions Prema Powerteam for a double program in Italian F4 and ADAC Formula 4. The move yielded better results for Famularo straightaway, as he scored a podium in the Italian F4 season opener at Vallelunga. He then went on to win at the Zandvoort ADAC F4 round in August, after a tyre gamble to start a wet race on slicks. Those were only two only podiums of the year, but regular points finishes in both series meant he finished 12th in Italian F4 and 15th in ADAC F4, of which he sat out the last three rounds.
