=== Critiques ===
Donald G. Gillin, a Sinologist affiliated with Hoover Institution, wrote a book Falsifying China's History: The Case of Sterling Seagrave's The Soong Dynasty, in which he criticised Seagrave's book The Soong Dynasty as being biased against Chiang Kai-shek.Dragon Lady challenges the notion that the Empress Dowager Cixi used the Boxers in the Boxer Rebellion. Kang Youwei is said to be the source of false stories which stained her reputation. In the book, Cixi is portrayed sympathetically.
In its review of Gold Warriors: America's Secret Recovery of Yamashita's Gold, which dealt with allegations that post World War II the CIA had misappropriated billions of dollars of Japanese war loot (the titular Yamashita's Gold), BBC History Magazine noted that whilst "numerous gaps remain.... this is an important story, with far-reaching implications, that deserves to receive further attention".
