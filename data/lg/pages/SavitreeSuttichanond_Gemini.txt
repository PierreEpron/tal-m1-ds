Savitree Suttichanond (Thai: สาวิตรี สุทธิชานนท์; RTGS: Sawittri Sutthichanon; born June 8, 1985) is a Thai singer best known for competing in the 5th season of reality talent show True Visions's Academy Fantasia. She is now completing her role as a contestant on the show, which includes performing in a nationwide concert tour in late August to September 2008.


== Biography ==
Savitree Suttichanond, also known as Beau or Beau Savitree, was born in Thailand but has lived in the United States for the past decade. After graduating with a double major in Political Science and International Studies from the University of California, Irvine, she was offered a job at a prestigious law firm, where she worked for less than one year before moving back to Thailand to pursue her dream of becoming a pop star. While attending the University of California, Irvine, Savitree was a member of the Delta Delta Delta sorority, was a SPOP staffer, and actively participated in the university's Thai Club. Savitree was also active in ITSA (Intercollegiate Thai Student Association) in helping organize events put on by Thai clubs from other universities such as University of California, Riverside, California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, the University of California, Los Angeles, the University of Southern California, California State University, Long Beach, the University of California, San Diego, and California State University, Fullerton. She always performed in the ITSA Karaoke and Singing contests with stellar performances.


=== Academy Fantasia ===
Savitree competed in the fifth season of Academy Fantasia and was eliminated during the ninth week of the show. She made it into the top 16 from the clip (online) auditions, and survived the first elimination ranking first place in votes for the first week. She was the only contestant remaining from the clip auditions for the last five weeks that she was on the show.
Savitree's elimination came as a shock to audiences everywhere. Many believe that it was unfair for her to have been eliminated, because the voting for the ninth week included a surprise vote in which a contestant who had been voted off in the previous six weeks could have the chance to return. This skewed the votes incredibly, making it so that the seven contestants remaining on the show (including Savitree) together had only 35% of the vote, and the votes of the seven contestants ended up being within 0.42% of each other. With such little difference between their votes, even a small number of votes could make a huge difference, so voting for week nine was more dependent on luck and chance rather than talent and popularity.
