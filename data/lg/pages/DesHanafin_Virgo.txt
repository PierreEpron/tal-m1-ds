P. Brady, on 28 August 1958 in Clonmel, Tipperary. The wedding was followed by a reception at the Galtee Hotel, Cahir, which was attended by various notables including Rev. Father J. J. Hampson, President of Blackrock College. Their first child, Mary Hanafin, was born in June 1959, followed by John Hanafin in September 1960.

Initially successful, the business failed in 1967, which Mary Hanafin later blamed on her father's excess drinking. Subsequently, Hanafin was a director of the Transinternational Oil Company.
