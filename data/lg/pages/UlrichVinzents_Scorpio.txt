He scored his first and only competitive goal for the club against Jönköpings Södra IF in Svenska Cupen on 11 May 2011. Vinzents signed a new contract on 22 June 2011 to keep him at the club for another season.After captain Daniel Andersson decided to focus on his coaching role for the 2012 season Vinzents was given the captain's armband. However as Vinzents had some trouble with injuries throughout the season he only acted as captain for a few matches, most notably in his last match for Malmö FF on 4 November in an away game against AIK. On 1 November 2012, it was announced that Vinzents would leave the club after seven seasons. He was given a farewell ceremony on the pitch at Swedbank Stadion after the last home match of the season against Örebro SK.
