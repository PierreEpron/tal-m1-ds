Christopher John Gilbey  (born 13 May 1946, Islington) is an English-born Australian entrepreneur and music industry identity. His more recent activities are in the field of materials science and signals processing from graphene-coated materials, a long way from the career he is best known for: shaping the careers of recording artists such as INXS, Tommy Emmanuel, Keith Urban, The Church, The Saints, AC/DC, Wa Wa Nee, Euphoria, Edith Bliss and Stevie Wright. He has authored two books.


== Early years ==
Chris Gilbey was born at Whittington Hospital in North London. He attended Tollington Boys High School in Muswell Hill and subsequently The South African College School in Cape Town, South Africa. He dropped out of university and became a computer programmer for a period. He studied engineering at the University of Cape Town before returning to the UK to pursue a career in the music industry. Chris formed a pop group called Kate, which was signed to CBS Records in the UK. He co-wrote several singles by the band including its first single, "Strange Girl", which was a Melody Maker "record of the week".After Kate disbanded in 1969, Gilbey established a leather fashion business called Woof. He designed a number of Hobbit-inspired clothes, which were sold in Carnaby Street. His suede, hooded capes came to the attention of Twiggy, who modelled them. Despite this, the venture was unsuccessful and Gilbey closed it in 1972. Gilbey migrated to Australia in November 1972.

He produced the band's first hit single, "The Unguarded Moment", and debut album, Of Skins and Heart.
Gilbey left ATV Northern Songs at the time that the company was acquired by Robert Holmes a Court, and established a venture with MCA Music. During the next eleven years Gilbey built one of the most successful independent publishing companies in Australia and signed writers such as Allan Caswell, INXS, Noiseworks, Peter Blakeley, Tommy Emmanuel, Sharon O'Neill, Shona Laing, Don Spencer and Wa Wa Nee, as well as producing hit records with The Sunnyboys and Doug Mulray.Subsequent to this, Gilbey became the Senior Executive VP of BMG Records in Australia, and led the development of one of the first transactional music web sites as well as the development of the enhanced CD. In 1978, Gilbey, along with Peter Hebbes, Ross Barlow and Jack Argent, launched The Golden Stave Luncheon. 187 members of Australia's music industry attended the first charity event at Sydney's Sebel Townhouse in 1978.
