Silvy De Bie (born 4 January 1981), also known as Sil (stylised as SIL) or Silvy Melody, is a Belgian singer. She is the vocalist for the dance music group Sylver.


== Career ==
Silvy was born in Heist-op-den-Berg, and became a Flanders child star when she was nine years old.  She sang "Ben" (a Michael Jackson song written by Walter Scharf) on the Flemish showbiz TV show De Kinderacademie ("Child Academy"). The show was not a contest, but an entertainment program, where children between 4 and 12 years old could perform an act (singing act, dance act, telling a little fairy tale or poem etc.).
Her performance was so well-received that an independent recording studio signed her to a contract. Under the name Silvy Melody, she recorded some songs (including a Dutch version of "Ben") as a solo artist and also some numbers together with other famous Belgian singers.  Many of her songs were in the top 10 charts. Her career as a child star stopped abruptly in 1994 due to the Belgian law regarding child labour which is forbidden in Belgium.
In 2000, she became the female vocalist for the dance music group Liquid feat.; later in 2001 the group's name was changed to Sylver. Alongside the successes with Sylver, she also had a solo career. In 2001, she worked with MNC, with whom she covered the Eurythmics song "Sweet Dreams".
She also worked with the group Milk Inc. (her friend is singer Linda Mertens). In 2004, the single "I Don't Care" reached the Belgian top ten. In 2007, she collaborated for the single "Time" along with 4 Clubbers in Belgium. She wrote the song "Lovesong" from the Crossroads album.
In 2016 she cameback to be the female vocalist for the dance music group Sylver.
