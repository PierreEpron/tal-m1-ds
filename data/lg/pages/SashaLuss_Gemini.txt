Alexandra "Sasha" Alexeyevna Luss (Russian: Александра "Саша" Алексеевна Лусс; born 6 June 1992) is a Russian model and actress best known for portraying Anna Poliatova in the 2019 film Anna.


== Early life ==
Luss was born in Magadan, Magadan Oblast, and moved to Moscow at a young age. As a child, she had no interest in pursuing a modelling career, preferring to spend her time writing and dancing. She frequently participated in ballet competitions before she suffered an ankle injury which prevented her from continuing her hobby. Her mother's friends and even strangers would compliment Sasha's modelling potential. When Sasha was 13 years old, her mother took her to visit a modelling agency, where she was signed. Luss has stated that her grandmother disapproved of this career move, claiming that modelling is a terrible, immoral business.
