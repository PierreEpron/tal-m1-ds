O'Rourke was a centre half who played for Celtic, Burnley, Lincoln City, Third Lanark and Chesterfield before his final playing days at Bradford City. He became player-manager in 1905 following the departure of Robert Campbell while he was still captain. He was given the job permanently and in December 1905 played his final game in an FA Cup tie against Darlington.
He led the Bantams to the Second Division championship in 1908. Three years later, O'Rourke clinched the FA Cup with Bradford in 1911, beating Newcastle United 1–0 in a replay. His son, Francis, died in Newfoundland in October 1919, affecting him deeply, and in June 1921, due to ill health, O'Rourke retired from the game.He came back with Welsh side Pontypridd in 1922 for five months. In December of that year, O'Rourke joined Dundee Hibernian, who were then a non-league club, but stayed for only three months, resigning after lacking financial support. His next managerial job was with Bradford Park Avenue from 1924 to 1925. He spent just ten months at Park Avenue but signed another son, Peter, who scored twice on his debut against Durham City.He returned to Bradford City in 1928, winning the Third Division North the following year. After leaving Bradford for the second time in 1930, he moved to Walsall, before a final managerial spell with Llanelli. He retired in July 1933.
After retiring, O'Rourke returned to Bradford living in Burlington Terrace next to City's Valley Parade ground until he died in January 1956 at the age of 82.
