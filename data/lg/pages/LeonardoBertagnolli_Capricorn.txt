Leonardo Bertagnolli (born 8 January 1978 in Trento) is a retired Italian professional road bicycle racer, who rode as a professional between 2002 and 2012. He signed for Amica Chips–Knauf, a new team in the 2009 season, though he rode for Diquigiovanni–Androni in the 2009 Giro d'Italia. It was unclear if Bertagnolli switched teams before Amica Chips–Knauf's mid-season collapse or after, and whether he continued with Diquigiovanni–Androni after the Giro or briefly returned to Amica Chips–Knauf.
Bertagnolli announced his retirement from the sport after competing in the Italian National Championships in June 2012. It later emerged that the Union Cycliste Internationale had launched disciplinary proceedings into Bertagnolli, in the light of an alleged anti-doping violation via his biological passport, and he was given a sanction of 2 years and ten months as well as disqualified from 1 January 2003 to 18 May 2011.
