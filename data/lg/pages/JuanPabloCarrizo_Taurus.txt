Juan Pablo Carrizo (born 6 May 1984) is an Argentine former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper.
He started his professional career with River Plate, where he played until 2008, winning the 2008 Clausura. His performances earned him a move to Europe, where he played for Lazio in Italy and on loan for Zaragoza in Spain, before returning at River Plate again, this time on loan. Carrizo was again loaned by Lazio this time to Calcio Catania where he played until June 2012. In January 2013, Internazionale purchased him as a back-up for Samir Handanović.
A former Argentina international, Carrizo played 12 matches for his country, representing them in 2007 and 2011 editions of Copa América.


== Club career ==


=== River Plate ===
Carrizo made his debut with River Plate on 29 January 2006 against Tiro Federal, keeping a clean sheet in River's 5–0 thrashing of the Rosario club. He played with River Plate until the last game of the 2008 Clausura, helping the team obtain the national championship.


=== Lazio ===
Carrizo was supposed to move to Lazio in the summer (July–August) transfer window of 2007, but the deal fell through over complications regarding Carrizo's eligibility for European citizenship. He finally registered with the Lega Nazionale Professionisti on 6 June 2008.
On 8 July 2008, Carrizo arrived in Rome and was formally presented to the media and fans as a Lazio player for the first time, stating his ambition of winning the Derby della Capitale against local rivals Roma.
However, Carrizo's lost his place as first-choice goalkeeper during his first season after a 1–4 home defeat to Cagliari on 25 January 2009 when coach Delio Rossi opted to replace him with Uruguayan Fernando Muslera. Throughout his time on the Lazio bench, Carrizo repeatedly voiced his discontent at losing his place, and thus Lazio elected to fine him €20,000.


==== Loan at Zaragoza ====
At the end of the season, Carrizo was loaned out to newly promoted Spanish club Real Zaragoza as part of the deal which saw Matuzalém become a permanent Lazio player until 2012. He was forced to share his spot as the number one goalkeeper due to strong competition with Roberto Jiménez Gago and Javier López Vallejo, but managed to make 16 league appearances, in addition, one Copa del Rey match, as the team avoided the relegation in the final weeks.


==== Loan at River Plate ====
On 18 June 2010, he returned on loan to River Plate, where he signed until 30 June 2011.


==== Loan at Catania ====
On 31 January 2012, Carrizo was loaned out with option rights to Catania replacing its former goalkeeper Mariano Andújar who had returned on loan to Estudiantes de la Plata in Argentina following a fallout with the club's directors. Carrizo made his debut for the club on 22 February 2012, making three decisive saves and keeping a clean sheet in a 0–1 away victory over Siena.


=== Internazionale ===
On 31 January 2013, in the last day of winter transfer window, Carrizo joined fellow Serie A side Internazionale for a fee of €250,000.

The Argentinian served as a second choice goalkeeper after Luca Castellazzi suffered an injury. Carrizo made his debut for the club against Bologna in Serie A on 10 March 2013, as Inter suffered a 0–1 home defeat at San Siro. This was his first and only appearance for 2012–13 season, and Inter finished the Serie A season in a disappointing 9th place.

On 30 June, Inter announced Carrizo had extended his Inter contract until 2017.On 2 March 2016, in the returning leg of Coppa Italia's semi-final against Juventus at San Siro, Carrizo started the match and made several vital saves, including one in the 120 minute against Álvaro Morata, helping Inter overturn the 3–0 defeat and equal the aggregate 3–3, which led the match into the penalty shootouts; he did not save any of Juventus' penalties, as Inter lost 3–5 and eventually was eliminated from the competition.Carrizo made his first competitive appearance of 2016–17 season on 24 November 2016 in the matchday 5 of 2016–17 UEFA Europa League group stage against Hapoel Be'er Sheva, entering as a substitute for Handanović who was sent-off in the 69th minute, conceding two times in an eventual 3–2 away defeat, which confirmed the elimination of Inter from Europa League.
