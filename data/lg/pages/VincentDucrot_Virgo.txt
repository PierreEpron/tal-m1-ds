=== Transport Publics Fribourgeois (TPF) ===
On 17 November 2010, Vincent Ducrot was named managing director of Transports publics Fribourgeois (TPF) with effect from 1 July 2011. He transformed the TPF into a holding company in 2015. Under his leadership, the number of passengers has risen from 25.7 million in 2011 to 32.5 million in 2018, and the number of employees has increased from 700 to nearly 1,200.At the head of the TPFs, he carried out several infrastructure modernisation projects, including new-generation stations, notably in Bossonnens, Belfaux, Pensier, Münchenwiler-Courgevaux, Montbovon and Châtel-St-Denis. Between 2014 and 2019, five new real estate districts have also been created around stations designed as new living spaces, i.e. those of Bulle and Châtel-St-Denis.In spring 2019, the director saw the completion of another huge project that he initiated at Givisiez: the new TPF Maintenance and Administrative Centre. Named "Givisiez Ensemble", this 70,000 m2 complex brings together the company's maintenance activities, operations centre and administration in a single location.Its track record also includes technological innovations for TPF users, including participation in the launch of FAIRTIQ (a mobile ticketing app released by 21 Swiss transport companies) and the introduction of SMS ticketing (an application for purchasing bus tickets by SMS.)In 2017, the TPFs also opened the first test line of Navya SAS autonomous shuttles in Marly, where electric vehicles could run without driving personnel after the test phase.


=== CEO of Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) ===
On 10 December 2019, the board of directors of Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) announced the appointment of Vincent Ducrot to the position of CEO, with effect from 1 April 2020. He replaces Andreas Meyer, who had been at the head of the country's largest public transport company since 2007 and had announced – in September 2019 – his intention to step down in 2020. The engineer from Fribourg thus becomes the first person from French-speaking Switzerland in almost 50 years to head the SBB. The new SBB director faces an initial, unforeseen and enormous challenge from the outset: the organisation and management of rail traffic, which has been greatly reduced since 19 March 2020, due to the coronavirus pandemic, and the planning for the resumption of normal rail traffic operations after the lockdown. In particular, Vincent Ducrot will have to deal with the economic challenges posed by the health crisis for the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), which posted a loss of almost 500 million Swiss francs in the first half of 2020.


=== Opinions ===
At the head of the Transports publics fribourgeois (TPF), Vincent Ducrot has invested in the development of autonomous electric shuttles by commissioning (in 2017) the first test line of Navya SAS autonomous shuttles in Marly. He is convinced that autonomous vehicles on the road and also on the rails will play an important role in the public transport of the future.
