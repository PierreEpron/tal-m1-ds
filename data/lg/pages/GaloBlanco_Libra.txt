== Tennis career ==
Most of Blanco's early professional tour appearances were earned by qualifying for tournaments. He would do so by winning the qualifier's rounds that are usually played before the tournaments themselves, to fill one last tournament spot. It was that way that he was able to participate at the Fairmonts tournament in Scottsdale, Arizona, U.S. in 1996, for example.
Blanco eventually began to be invited to tournaments, and his name has gained reasonable importance in the men's professional circuit. He came closest to winning a Grand Slam title in 1997, reaching the quarterfinals of the French Open by defeating Neville Godwin, Magnus Gustafsson, Chris Woodruff and Petr Korda before losing to Pat Rafter. He won his only title in 1999 San Marino GO&FUN Open to his countryman Albert Portas and reached the final (2001 Mexican Open) and the semifinals in 2000 Majorca Open losing to eventual champion Marat Safin.
Blanco had two high-profile wins in majors, beating former 2-time US Open Champion, Patrick Rafter, in the first round of the 2000 US Open, and in beating Pete Sampras in the second round of the 2001 French Open.
Blanco lost in the second round of the 2004 Australian Open. He announced his retirement after the 2006 Torneo Godó.
