== Professional career ==


=== Arizona Cardinals ===
Calvin was selected by the Arizona Cardinals in the sixth round (201st overall) of the 2010 NFL Draft.


=== Philadelphia Eagles ===
Calvin was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles on August 30, 2010, in exchange for fullback Charles Scott, who was selected one pick before Calvin in the 2010 NFL Draft.Calvin became the starting kickoff returner for the Eagles after Ellis Hobbs suffered an injury early in the season. Hobbs regained the starting job after Calvin fumbled the ball on a return, but after Hobbs was placed on injured reserve with a neck injury, Calvin took back the job for the November 28 game against the Chicago Bears.On December 12, 2010, Calvin fielded a kickoff from Dallas Cowboys kicker David Buehler in the Eagles' own end zone. Calvin then jogged around the end zone without crossing the goal line and introducing the ball into the field of play, or "downing" the ball and ending the play with a touchback. Head coach Andy Reid said Calvin was told to run around because the Cowboys' kickoff team was so used to Buehler kicking touchbacks that they typically did not complete the coverage. Immediately following, Calvin was involved in an on-field altercation with Cowboys cornerback Alan Ball, resulting in an unnecessary roughness penalty for Calvin. Calvin was placed on injured reserve on December 23 after suffering a back injury in a week 15 game against the New York Giants.Calvin was waived by the Eagles on September 1, 2011.
