== Early life ==
Brown was born in St. Louis, Missouri to Sterling Brown and Aralean (Banks) Brown. He has two sisters and two brothers. His father died when he was 10 years old.As a child, he went by the name Kelby; when he turned 16, he adopted the name Sterling, explaining in 2016:

I went by Kelby. My mom tells me this story – she was reiterating it the other day – in kindergarten I came home one day and said, 'Mom, Sterling is eight letters and Kelby is five. I'll just do Kelby and then when I turn 16, I will go by Sterling.' And I don't remember that. The impetus for me is that he had been gone for some time, and I was like, 'Kelby was a little boy's name.' I felt like I was ready to become Sterling.
