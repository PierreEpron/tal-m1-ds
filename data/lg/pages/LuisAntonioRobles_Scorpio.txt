Luis Antonio Robles Suárez (24 October 1849 – 22 September 1899) also known as "El Negro Robles", was a Colombian lawyer and politician. He was the first Afro-Colombian to hold a cabinet-level ministry in Colombia serving as Secretary of the Treasury and Public Credit during the administration of President Aquileo Parra Gómez, as well as being the first Afro-Colombian Congressperson as Member of the Chamber of Representatives for Magdalena, and the first Afro-Colombian Governor of a Department, as the 16th President of the Sovereign State of Magdalena. He graduated a lawyer from Our Lady of the Rosary University in 1872, thus also becoming the first Afro-Colombian to ever serve as a lawyer in Colombia.

It is not my fault that I am Black: Night has imprinted her mantle over my epidermis. But the bones of my ancestors in the vaults of Cartagena still whiten, for giving freedom to many Whites of black consciences such as yours.
I won't be silenced! I have the right to speak as a representative of the people. Yes, I belong the Black race, redeemed by the Republic, and my duty is to serve those who shattered its yoke.
