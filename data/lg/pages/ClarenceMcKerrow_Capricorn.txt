== Career ==
As an ice hockey player an 18-year old McKerrow, weighing only 115 pounds at the time and considered too young and too light for senior hockey, sat on the Montreal Hockey Club bench for the entirety of the 1894–95 regular season. But when Billy Barlow was absent for the March 9, 1895 Stanley Cup challenge game against the Queen's University team of the OHA, McKerrow was called upon to play, scoring a goal while his team defended the Stanley Cup, and from there on he was a fixture on the team roster.In March 1902 McKerrow coached the Montreal Hokey Club, then dubbed the "Little Men of Iron" because of the small stature of many of its players (including Dickie Boon, Archie Hooper, Jimmy Gardner and Jack Marshall), to a Stanley Cup victory over the Winnipeg Victorias.In 1908 he was part of the Canadian lacrosse team which won the gold medal in the Summer Olympics, alongside future ice hockey magnate Tommy Gorman.McKerrow died in Montreal on October 20, 1959.
