Like some of his brothers, he became a rower for the Venetian rowing club Francesco Querini named for the polar explorer who died in 1900. In 1908, Del Giudice became Italian champion in the coxed four alongside his twin brother; his brother had first won an Italian championship three years earlier. At the 1908 European Championships, the brothers became European champions in the coxed four.In 1909, the twin brothers became Italian champions in coxed four and the eight; that year their younger brother Curzio (1894–1950) was rowing with them in the eight. The 1909 European Rowing Championships were held in Paris and the twins won gold in the coxed four. When the men's eight started, most of the rowers had already been part of the earlier boats that day and the team was beaten by the French who, apart from Gaston Delaplane, rowed their first competition that day; the Italians including the three Del Giudice brothers had to settle for silver.In 1910, the twin brothers became Italian champion in the coxed four. At the 1910 European Rowing Championships in Ostend, they won gold with the coxed four.At the 1911 European Rowing Championships held on Lake Como, the judges had difficulty in deciding on the winner of the coxed four and eventually awarded the gold medal to the Swiss team, with the Italian team including the Del Giudice twins getting silver. With the eight, they won gold at those championships.In 1912, the Italian selection in the men's eight was decided between the two Venetian clubs – Bucintoro and Querini. There was a collision and a scuffle broke out between the rowers. Both clubs were banned from competitions for one year by the Italian Rowing Federation and Italy's Olympic appearance in the eight was cancelled.
