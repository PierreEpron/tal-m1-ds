== Club career ==


=== Swindon Town ===
Bodin began his career with Swindon Town, moving from the youth set-up, where he finished top scorer in both the youth side and the reserves during the 2009–10 season, to become a professional in April 2010. Bodin was an unused substitute on the Swindon bench on 20 March 2010 in their 1–1 league draw against Norwich City.
On 2 October 2010, Bodin followed in his father's footsteps by making his first-team debut for Swindon Town as a late substitute in a 2–1 League One defeat to Dagenham & Redbridge, replacing Thomas Dossevi. Swindon were relegated to League Two after finishing 24th, and Bodin expressed hopes for first-team opportunities the following season.Having returning to Swindon in early January 2012 from a loan spell, Bodin scored his first goals for the club, the final goal in a 4–1 victory over Southend United on 31 January 2012 and another in the next game, a 3–0 win over Crawley Town on 14 February 2012. His third goal came against Dagenham & Redbridge in a 4–0 win on 6 March 2012.


=== Torquay United (loan) ===
On 25 August 2011, Bodin joined Torquay United on loan until January 2012. He made his Torquay debut in a 1–1 draw with Dagenham & Redbridge on 27 August 2011, coming on as a substitute and winning a penalty, which was converted by Rene Howe. On 13 September 2011, he scored his first goal for the club in a 2–2 draw against Cheltenham Town, and he scored again the following week in a 3–3 draw against Rotherham United. His next goal came on 29 October 2015 in a 1–0 win over Hereford United, and he scored again on 5 November 2011 in a 3–0 win over Crewe. After his goal against Hereford United, manager Martin Ling predicted big things for Bodin since becoming established in the first team. On 2 January 2012, Bodin scored his 6th goal in a 2–1 win over Plymouth Argyle. Bodin's good performances led Torquay unsuccessfully to seek a loan extension until the end of the season. After leaving Torquay, Bodin paid tribute to Ling, crediting his tactical changes with stopping the club's nosedive at the start of the season.


=== Crewe Alexandra (loan) ===
In March 2012, he was loaned to Crewe Alexandra for the remainder of the season. Bodin made his debut for the club in a 1–0 win over Hereford United on 24 March 2012.


=== Torquay United ===
On 2 July 2012, Torquay United signed Bodin for an undisclosed fee believed to be around £70,000, beating Crewe who had also attempted to sign him. Bodin suffered knee ligament damage whilst playing for Torquay against Dagenham & Redbridge in April 2014. His contract expired during the summer of 2014.


=== Northampton Town ===
In January 2015, Bodin joined Northampton Town on a deal until the end of the season having spent time at the club during his knee ligament injury rehabilitation. Bodin made four substitute appearances for the Cobblers before leaving in the summer.


=== Bristol Rovers ===


==== 2015–16 season ====
Bodin went on to sign for Bristol Rovers in July 2015 on a short-term deal, following a successful trial at the club.
He scored his first goal for Rovers in a 3–0 away win against Hartlepool,  his second against Morecambe in a 4–3 win away from home, and his third, a spectacular effort, in a 1–4 loss to Newport County. He also scored against Dagenham & Redbridge and high-flying Plymouth Argyle, to finish the season with 5 goals, helping his side to achieve promotion to Football League One. On 9 June 2016 he signed a new two-year deal to stay at Rovers.


==== 2016–17 season ====
Bodin did not score in the 2016–17 season until a volley in a 3–2 defeat to Chesterfield in November. By the turn of the year he was on four goals, thanks to a Boxing Day hat trick in a 4–1 victory over Coventry City, all scored with his left foot: a shot from the edge of the box into the far top corner, a long shot from 25 yards and a penalty. He scored a fine goal against Northampton Town during a 5–0 thrashing, but it was overshadowed by teammate Ellis Harrison's four.


==== 2017–18 season ====
Bodin scored his first two goals of the season with a brace on 8 August 2017, in a 4–1 EFL Cup victory over Cambridge United, his second match of the campaign. His first two league goals of the season came in a 3–2 victory away to Bury: a header from a cross from Joe Partington to make it 2–0 and a close-range effort to make it 3–0. On 7 October 2017, Bodin opened the scoring as Rovers defeated his former club Northampton 6–0  away from home; however, in doing so he suffered an injury that kept him out of the team for over a month.Bodin departed Bristol Rovers on 3 January 2018, having scored 13 goals in the first half of the season for the club.


=== Preston North End ===
On 3 January 2018, Bodin joined EFL Championship club Preston North End for an undisclosed fee, signing a two-and-a-half-year contract with the club. He was assigned shirt number 39 on his arrival at Deepdale. He made his debut on 6 January 2018 in a 5–1 victory away at Wycombe Wanderers in the FA Cup 3rd round. The injury problems that had plagued Bodin in the earlier part of his career returned during his time at Preston and he missed the entirety of the 2018–19 season with an anterior cruciate ligament injury.In October 2019 he signed a new contract with PNE until summer 2021. On 13 May 2021, it was confirmed that Bodin would be leaving the club at the end of his contract.


=== Oxford United ===
