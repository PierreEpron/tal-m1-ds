Paul Noworyta is an American professional vert skater who became the first and only athlete in the world to compete on the pro vert circuit after receiving a kidney transplant at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio on September 6, 1989. Noworyta started riding vert ramps in 1983 and later became the oldest rookie pro the sport had ever seen at age 33. He wrote a book about his life in 2006 called "Transplant to Handplant" and is an outspoken kidney transplant advocate. He now operates the website KidneysAreSexy.com. His favorite tricks on vert are McTwist 540, big disaster inverts, and backflips.
