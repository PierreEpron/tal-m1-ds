Enrique Ricardo Lewandowski (Portuguese pronunciation: [ẽˈʁiki ʁiˈkaʁdu lɛvɐ̃ ˈdɔvski]; born May 11, 1948) is a  Brazilian judge and former justice of the Supreme Federal Court of Brazil.Lewandowski presided over the impeachment trial of president Dilma Rousseff, and controversially separated the cassation of her term from the cassation of her political rights. Two votes, then, occurred, and, upon losing her mandate, she maintained her political rights. Vice President Michel Temer succeeded her.
Lewandowski was replaced by Carmen Lúcia who was championed by José Celso de Mello Filho, Brazil's most senior jurist. Lewandowski had been known for championing a reduction in oversight of judges and an increase in their remuneration. Lucia's champion gave a speech talking about the need to remove corruption despite the presence of a number of alleged suspects.
