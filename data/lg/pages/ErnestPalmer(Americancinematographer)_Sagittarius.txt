Ernest George Palmer (December 6, 1885 – February 22, 1978) was a Hollywood cinematographer for more than 160 films. His earliest known credit was for a 1912 adaptation of Ivanhoe.


== Biography ==
Palmer was born in Kansas City, Missouri. In 1941, he won an Oscar for Best Cinematography (in collaboration with Ray Rennahan) for Blood and Sand. Palmer was nominated on several other occasions—in 1928 for Four Devils, in 1929 for Street Angel, and in 1950 for Broken Arrow.
Palmer died in Pacific Palisades, California. He is sometimes confused with a British cinematographer of the same name (1901–1964) who worked on various UK films and television programmes until the early 1960s.
