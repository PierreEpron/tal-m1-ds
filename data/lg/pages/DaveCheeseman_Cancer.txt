Dave Cheeseman (born David James Cheeseman, 24 June 1978, Hull, England) is a prolific English underground session musician, known for his work with Sack Trick and Pillow Talk.


== Biography ==
Cheeseman started playing the keyboard after being inspired by Guns N' Roses' live music video of "November Rain", in which frontman Axl Rose can be seen engaging a stadium crowd whilst seated behind a piano. Van Halen and later Dream Theater became the focus of his musical fixations and provided inspiration for his pursuit of keyboard playing perfection.
Cheeseman played keyboards in the York heavy metal outfit Beyond Redemption, with Gideon Letch, Mark Burnett and Evil Clive Jevons, achieving success on the local and underground international metal scene.  The band were also notorious for their stage show, which inevitably involved band members stripping to the waist.
Later on, he founded Pillow Talk with James Jirgens, Gideon Letch and Mark Burnett.  The band's shambolic comedy rock caught the attention of Chris Dale of Sack Trick, who recruited Cheeseman for his own rock outfit.
In the meantime Cheeseman played drums for several Nottingham based indie bands including the  underground folk rockers, Heroic Trio.  He also plays bass guitar in a tribute band, Beyond Comprehension.
Cheeseman also plays for Twin Zero, a Reuben Gotto rock project based in London.
Cheeseman is also a Hull City A.F.C. supporter and is regularly seen at the KC Stadium.
