== Life and career ==
Schuck was born in Boston, Massachusetts to Mary (née Hamilton) and Conrad John Schuck, a professor at SUNY Buffalo. He is of English and German descent.He made his first theatrical appearances at Denison University, and after graduating continued his career at the Cleveland Play House, Baltimore's Center Stage, and finally the American Conservatory Theater, where he was discovered by Robert Altman.
His first film appearance was as Capt. Walter Kosciuszko "Painless Pole" Waldowski in M*A*S*H (1970). As Painless, Schuck holds a place in Hollywood history as the first person to say "fuck" in a major studio film. He went on to appear in several more Altman films: Brewster McCloud (1970), McCabe & Mrs. Miller (1971), and Thieves Like Us (1974).In 1970 he appeared as insurance salesman and former Minnesota Vikings lineman Frank Carelli in Episode 5 of the first season of The Mary Tyler Moore Show, "Keep Your Guard Up."
From 1971 to 1977, Schuck appeared as San Francisco Police Detective Sergeant Charles Enright in the television series McMillan & Wife and also starred as an overseer in the miniseries Roots. In 1976, he played Gregory "Yoyo" Yoyonovich in the short-lived series Holmes & Yoyo; both it and McMillan & Wife were created and produced by Leonard B. Stern for what is now NBCUniversal Television. Schuck starred in ABC's 1979 TV holiday special The Halloween That Almost Wasn't as the Frankenstein Monster. (He would again use the Universal International Frankenstein-monster makeup format in The Munsters Today; see below.) In 1979 he starred in a short-lived TV series version of Turnabout, where he and Sharon Gless played Sam and Penny, a couple who trade bodies. Some installments from that comedy series were reedited into the made-for-TV film Magic Statue, named for the artifact that caused the body-swap. In the 1970s–80s, Schuck was also a regular "guest celebrity" on game shows such as Pyramid, Hollywood Squares, Password Plus and Super Password and The Cross-Wits. During this period, he made his Broadway debut playing Oliver "Daddy" Warbucks as a replacement in the role of the original Broadway musical comedy Annie at the Alvin Theatre, for a special three-week engagement. In 1980, he began appearing as a "regular replacement" for a year and a half, along with Allison Smith as Annie and Alice Ghostley as Miss Hannigan.

He guest starred in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine as Legate Parn, Star Trek: Voyager as Chorus #3, Star Trek: Enterprise as Antaak, and Babylon 5 as Draal in "The Long, Twilight Struggle" (1995).
