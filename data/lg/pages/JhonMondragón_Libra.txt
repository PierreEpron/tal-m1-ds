On 6 January 2016 Steven scored his first senior goal, netting the first in a 4–0 away routing of CD Mendi. He was an undisputed starter for the B-side during the campaign which ended in promotion, contributing 34 appearances. In the following season in the third tier, he was almost ever-present again (29 starts) before being promoted to the first team squad.
On 22 April 2017 Steven made his first team – and La Liga – debut, replacing injured Nikola Vujadinović in a 2–2 home draw against Sporting de Gijón. Eight days later he scored his first goal in the category, netting the first in a 2–2 home draw against Deportivo de La Coruña, and found the net again in his next appearance against Granada C.F., opening the scoring in a 2–1 victory. Nevertheless, at the season's end, Osasuna were relegated from the top division and Steven's contract was not renewed.
