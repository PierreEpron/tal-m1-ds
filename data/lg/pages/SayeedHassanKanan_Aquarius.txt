== Early life ==
Kanan's family included six siblings, and his father worked at the Bangladesh Government Press, also known as Central Press.
After the Bangladesh Liberation War, his family struggled financially, thus Kanan urged to become a footballer at office clubs, such as Team BJMC, Customs, Qaumi Jute Mills and various other spinning mills.


== Club career ==
Kanan grew up in the Badda area of Dhaka, and in 1979, he started playing in the Pioneer Football League with Naveen Krira Chakra, which is now Badda Jagoroni. In December 1979, Irish coach William Bill Hart of Dhaka League giants Abahani Krira Chakra held a goalkeeper tiral, for which players had to pay 30 rupees to join. Although, Kanan stood in line without paying, he was the first player selected by the coach.

 I saw about 30 balls in front of him. As soon as I stood in goal, he started shooting. I also jumped and saved some of his shots. Impressed with my keeping, I heard Bill Hart say to the other coaches, "I will take this boy. Fix the other two."
However, with Mohamed Mohsin being the first choice goalkeeper at Abahani, coach Ali Imam fixed Kanan a move to Farashganj SC, who were recently prmoted from the Second Division. He spent his first season at the club as the second choice, earning 30 thousand rupees, and by 1982 he became a regular face in the lineup. In 1983, he joined Brothers Union, and after a third place finish in his debut season at the club, Kanan moved to Mohammedan SC.
At Mohammedan SC he was the main goalkeeper for more than a decade, winning the Dhaka League five times, and was also part of the team which defeated Iranian giants Persepolis to reach the semi-final league round of the 1990–91 Asian Club Championship. He was the mainstay between the post as The Black and Whites were unbeaten in the league from 8 September 1985 to 15 March 1990.  In the final of the 1991 Independence Cup, he saved four shots in the tiebreaker against Abahani. In 1996, he conceded only six goals in the Dhaka League and retired from playing, as Mohammedan SC became undefeated champions.


== International career ==
Kanan replaced the injured Moinul Islam in the Bangladesh team for the 1986 FIFA World Cup qualifiers in Indonesia. Although he did not get selected from the main camp held by coach Abdur Rahim, a second selection round under the observation of Bangladesh Football Federation president Hafizuddin Ahmed, saw Kanan get a place in the team. In the national team he was mainly the second choice goalkeeper to Mohamed Mohsin. Nonetheless, he played three games at the 1988 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers, and was the main goalkeeper under Nasser Hejazi at the 1989 South Asian Games in Islamabad, Pakistan. His mistake against Pakistan in the final was heavily criticised by both media and fans. He collided with defender Monem Munna, while trying to clear the ball and missed, leaving an empty post as Haji Abdul Sattar scored. Kanan was the captain of the Bangladesh Red team at the  Bangladesh President's Gold Cup in 1989, however, missed the final due to an injury. He was replaced in goal by Showkat Ali Selim, whose penalty shoot-out heroics lead the team to victory over South Korea University. His international career came to an end after the 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, during which Bangladesh suffered a 8–0 defeat at the hands of Japan.
