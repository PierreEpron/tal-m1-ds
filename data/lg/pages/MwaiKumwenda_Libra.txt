== Early life and family ==

She is a Tumbuka by tribe and her name "Mwai" means "Lucky" in English. She has three brothers and three sisters. (Note 2) A fourth sister passed away and her father, Kennedy, died when she was young. She began playing netball in primary school. Kumwenda later described her early experiences playing the game. 
"For balls, we used plastic bags and put them under the fire to melt, then moulded them with our hands and tied them with string. For the goal posts, we cut down trees, like the ones outside. The goal rings were made from old tyres, like the ones on cars". 
She continued playing netball in secondary school and came to the attention of Griffin Sayenda, the Malawi national netball team coach. When Kumwenda was just fifteen, and with the encouragement of Sayenda, she moved to Blantyre to pursue a netball career.
