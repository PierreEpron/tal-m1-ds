Miyo Okamoto (岡本三代, Okamoto Miyo, born 1 July 1978) is a Japanese football manager and former player who played as a midfielder. She was most recently the head coach of the Thailand senior and under-20 women's national teams.
At the 2022 AFC Women's Asian Cup, her usage of unusual tactics and out-of-position players, such as striker Pitsamai Sornsai in defence, led to Thailand only winning a single match in the group stage and losing 7-0 to defending champions Japan in the quarter-finals, as well as both World Cup play-off matches to regional rivals Vietnam and Chinese Taipei. She was criticised after the tournament, but continued to hold on to her job and led the War Elephants to a silver medal at the 2021 Southeast Asian Games in Vietnam.
