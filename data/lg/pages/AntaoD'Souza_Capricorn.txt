Born and raised in Nagoa, Salcete, Goa (at the time part of Portuguese India), D'Souza's father emigrated to Karachi, Pakistan, at the time of independence in 1947, where D'Souza attended St Patrick's High School. His brothers, Vincent D'Souza and Joseph D'Souza, also played first-class cricket.
D'Souza toured England in 1962, heading the batting averages (53) as he remained not out in five of his six innings. His bowling was as ineffective as everyone else on that tour, which Pakistan lost 0â€“4. Domestically, D'Souza played for Pakistan International Airlines, Karachi Blues, Karachi, and Peshawar.Given a minimum of ten innings, D'Souza is one of only two Test cricketers whose batting averages exceeded their highest score.  The other was the Indian cricketer Sadashiv Shinde.In 1999, D'Souza migrated with his wife and their four children to Ontario, Canada.
