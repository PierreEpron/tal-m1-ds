Howard Wright Cutler (1883–1948) was an American architect known primarily for his designs of churches, schools and public buildings in Washington, D.C. and adjacent Montgomery County, Maryland.


== Early life and education ==
Cutler was born in Ouray, Colorado on February 19, 1883.  He studied engineering and architecture at the Rochester Athenium and Mechanics Institute in Rochester, New York (today known as Rochester Institute of Technology), graduating with a Bachelor of Architecture.
Cutler married Marie Katherine Zahn.  Their daughter, Katherine Cutler, was the first licensed female architect in the State of Maryland and collaborated with her father on a variety of projects.


== Career ==
Cutler worked at the firm of Gordon & Madden in Rochester until he established his own firm in 1907. During his Rochester years, he is credited with the design of the Kodak Tower, a 19-story skyscraper.
During World War I, Cutler served as a major for the Surgeon General’s staff, in charge of designing military hospitals in the United States, including an addition to Walter Reed Hospital. His other buildings included the Otten Tuberculosis Hospital at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and the General Hospital in Denver, Colorado.
After the war, he moved his family to Washington, D.C., where he established himself as the principal architect of Montgomery County’s academic architecture from the mid-1920s to the mid-1940s.  From 1919 to 1921, he was a partner in the firm of Cutler & Woodbridge, which later became Cutler and Moss, and later still his own solo practice. During this time, his architectural designs evolved from Art Deco to Classical Revival to Streamline Art Moderne.
The Cutler-designed Lincoln Temple United Church of Christ and Eldbrooke United Methodist Church in Washington, D.C., are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), and several other buildings he designed have been designated as historic sites by the Maryland Historical Trust or other authorities.Cutler continued the practice of architecture until his death in 1948.
