He commanded Camp San Luis Obispo and served as the United States Property & Fiscal Officer, and retired as a colonel.A Republican, Nimmo served in the California State Assembly (1973 to 1976) and California State Senate (1976 to 1980).In 1981, President Ronald Reagan appointed Nimmo to head the Veterans' Administration, and he served until 1982. Nimmo was known for his preference for cutting funding for VA programs. He referred to veterans groups as "greedy", and to Agent Orange as not much worse than a "little teenage acne", although his supporters argued that these quotes were taken out of context. His Deputy, Chuck Hagel, resigned in 1982 over disagreements with Nimmo.As VA Administrator, Nimmo was also accused of excessive expenditures on redecorating his office, leasing an expensive sedan as his official vehicle, and improperly using the employee designated as his driver. Nimmo reimbursed the government more than $6,000 to compensate for the driver's unauthorized overtime.After returning to California, Nimmo remained active in civic causes and local government, including service on the Atascadero City Council and a term as the city's mayor (June 26, 1990 to June 1994).
