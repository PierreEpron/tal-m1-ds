== Life and career ==
Thomas James Gould was born May 23, 1849, in Providence, Rhode Island to James Coggeshall Gould and Maria Littlefield Gould. He attended the local schools and entered the office of architect William R. Walker in 1868. They were joined in the office by Frank W. Angell in 1872 and Walker's son, W. Howard Walker, in 1874. In January, 1876 he formed a partnership with Walker, known as Walker & Gould. A major work of this partnership was Robinson Hall at Brown University, built in 1876-88 as the university library. In 1880 Gould and Angell made plans to form their own firm, and Walker & Gould dissolved December 31. Gould and Angell continued under the name of Gould & Angell, and the Walkers formed William R. Walker & Son.In 1893 a third architect, Frank H. Swift, was added to the partnership, which became known as Gould, Angell & Swift. A second office was opened in Boston under the management of Gould. When the firm was dissolved in 1897, Gould briefly carried on in Boston. He returned to Providence circa 1902, forming a new partnership with architect W. H. Colwell (1849-1906), known as Colwell & Gould. After Colwell's death in 1906, a new partnership, Gould & Hall, was formed with Benjamin M. Hall (1880-1960). This was dissolved in 1912 when Hall moved to form a general contracting company. This was followed by Gould's last partnership, Gould & Gould, with W. M. Gould. Gould retired from practice in 1919.
