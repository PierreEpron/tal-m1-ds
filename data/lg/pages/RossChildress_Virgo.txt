=== Collective Soul ===
Childress grew up with and had played with the original band members of Collective Soul before the group signed to Atlantic Records in early 1994. Over a period of eight years with the band, he recorded on, and toured in support of, five studio albums that have sold over seven million copies and generated seven #1 singles on the U.S. Billboard Mainstream Rock charts.  He left the band in September 2001, 2 weeks before the release of the greatest hits compilation 7even Year Itch with Joel Kosche taking his place.  The band had released a brief statement on its website regarding the departure, urging fans to understand that the situation was very personal. Collective Soul performed their first concert without Childress in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia on September 5.
During his time with Collective Soul, Childress was known for his metallic guitar sounds and heavy riffs incorporating elements of metal and blues in his playing. Along with front man Ed Roland, he penned many of the band's popular "hooks."  Childress wrote, sang lead vocals, and performed guitar on the song "Dandy Life" on the 1999 release Dosage. This was the first time that a member other than Ed Roland had sung lead on a studio recording.
