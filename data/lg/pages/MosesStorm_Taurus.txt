According to Storm, his family participated in a non-denominational religious sect known as "The Way", which was led by his uncle. Storm was mostly homeschooled by his mother. The family would travel from town to town, preaching at state fairs and music festivals.  From a young age, he watched Conan O'Brien by recording the episodes over Christian learning video tapes.
Storm attended one semester of community college for video production but diverged from the course. Upon recognizing his skill as a performer, he moved to Los Angeles and took a cleaning job. He claims that he then became a comedian when he realized he was "good at nothing else."
