Whilst Kaminski has represented Belgium's youth teams at its U15, U16, U17, U19 and U21 levels, Kaminski is also eligible to play for Poland due to his father being of Polish descent.
In May 2014, prior to the start of Belgium's 2014 FIFA World Cup campaign, Kaminski was called up to the national team's senior side for the first time after Thibaut Courtois was rested following his appearance in the 2014 UEFA Champions League Final and injuries to Koen Casteels, Silvio Proto and Simon Mignolet left the side with no other available options.Kaminski made the bench for Belgium's 5–1 defeat of Luxembourg in a friendly on 26 May, but the record of the match was dismissed by FIFA due to the side making seven substitutes instead of the maximum six substitutes permitted. Following the return of Courtois and Mignolet to the side, Kaminski's stint with the national team came to an end. 
On 9 October 2020, Kaminski was called up by Belgium manager Roberto Martínez for the side's UEFA Nations League games against England and Iceland. It was the first time Kaminski had been called by his national side in more than six years. He was then called up a month later on 9 November due to an injury to Anderlecht goalkeeper Hendrik Van Crombrugge, although he was forced to withdraw two days later due to testing positive for COVID-19.On 19 March 2021, Kaminski was called up yet again by Martínez, for the nation's 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Wales, Czech Republic and Belarus. In June, Kaminski was called up for friendly games against Greece and Croatia ahead of its UEFA Euro 2020 campaign, although Kaminski didn't initially make the squad for the tournament, until he was called up as a replacement for the injured Mignolet on 28 June. It was the first time that Kaminski had been called up by Belgium for a major tournament. His link-up with the squad didn't last long, however, as Belgium were defeated 2–1 by Italy in the quarter-finals.  
Kaminski was called up for the sixth time in under a year as he was named as part of Martínez's squad for the national's teams upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Estonia and the Czech Republic in August. He was called up, yet again, on 15 November for Belgium's World Cup qualifier against Wales.
