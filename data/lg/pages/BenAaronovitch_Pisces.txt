He has also written a novel and several short stories published by Big Finish Productions featuring the character of Bernice Summerfield, who was originally developed in the New Adventures.

=== Proposed serials of “Doctor Who” ===
Knight Fall
In May 1987, Aaronovitch submitted “Knight Fall” to the Doctor Who production office for Season 25. The story concerned privatization. Script editor Andrew Cartmel liked the story ideas, but felt that the script was inappropriate for the series and had too many supporting characters.Transit
After failing to feature Aaronovitch's “Knight Fall” storyline to production, Aaronovitch submitted a story in June 1987, entitled Transit. The story would see the Doctor and Ace in the future, land in a metro station, and discover transportation portals that could lead any body throughout the Solar System, but one of the portals leads a gate way to hell. Even though it is unexplainable to how Aaronovitch's scripts of “Transit” never came to fruition, he would adapt the story as a book for Virgin New Adventures series in December 1992.Bad Destination
During Summer of 1988, Aaronovitch submitted a three-part adventure story for Doctor Who’s 27th Season (which never came to fruition), and was called ”Bad Destination”. The story would feature The Doctor seeing Ace as a captain of a hospital spaceship which is being under attack by the Metatraxi. The story, however, was abandoned when, in September 1989, the BBC cancelled Doctor Who after its 26 Season, due to declining audiences. In July 2011, Big Finish Productions released the story as Earth Aid, by Aaronovitch and Cartmel.
