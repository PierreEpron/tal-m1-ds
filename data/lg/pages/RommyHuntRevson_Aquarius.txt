== Early years ==
Revson was born in 1944 in White Plains, New York. She worked in the 1970s and 1980s as a singer in Manhattan nightclubs. She was also a voice teacher and songwriter. While working as a singer, she met Revlon cosmetics heir John Revson. After a six-year courtship, they were married for a year.


== The scrunchie ==

In 1986, Revson invented the scrunchie, a hair accessory used to hold the hair in a pony tail. Revson invented the scrunchie while preparing for job interviews and trying to protect her brittle hair after having it bleached. She created the scrunchie out of soft fabric to avoid damaging her hair with elastic bands or plastic clips. She received a design patent for the invention.  The invention, originally known as the "Scunci", was named after Revson's pet poodle. It later became known generically as the scrunchie.Revson began a business to market her Scuncis and had $20 million in orders in the initial months.  Unable to keep up with demand, Revson's business failed. She thereafter licensed her patent for manufacture by others. By the time her patent expired in 2001, more than two billion Scrunchies had been sold. Revson made $1 million a year in royalties from the scrunchie for more than 12 years.
