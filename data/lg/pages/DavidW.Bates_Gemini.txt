David Bates (born June 5, 1957) is an American-born physician, biomedical informatician, and professor, who is internationally renowned for his work regarding the use of health information technology (HIT) to improve the safety and quality of healthcare, in particular by using clinical decision support.
Bates has done work in the area of medication safety. He began by describing the epidemiology of harm caused by medications, first in hospitalized patients and then in other settings such as the home and nursing homes. Subsequently, he demonstrated that by implementing computerized physician order entry (CPOE), medication safety could be dramatically improved in hospitals. This work led the Leapfrog Group to call CPOE one of the four changes that would most improve the safety of U.S. healthcare.  It also helped hospitals to justify investing in electronic health records and in particular, CPOE.
Throughout his career, Bates has published over 600 peer reviewed articles and is the most cited researcher in the fields of both patient safety and biomedical informatics, with an h-index of 115. In a 2013 analysis published by the European Journal of Clinical Investigation, he ranked among the top 400 living biomedical researchers of any type. He is currently editor of the Journal of Patient Safety.Bates serves as the chief of the Division of General Internal Medicine and Primary Care in the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and the medical director of clinical and quality analysis for information systems at Mass General Brigham. In addition, he is a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a professor of health policy and management at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He served as chief quality officer and senior vice president of Brigham and Women's from 2011 to 2014. He was appointed chief innovation officer in October 2014 to 2016, and he directs the Center for Patient Safety Research and Practice there. In addition, he serves as the director of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality funded Health Information Technology Center for Education and Research on Therapeutics (HIT-CERT) and the Patient Centered Learning Lab (PSLL) at the Brigham Center for Patient Safety Research and Practice.
