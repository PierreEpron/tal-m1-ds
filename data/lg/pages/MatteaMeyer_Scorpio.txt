== Early life and education ==

She obtained a MSc in Human and Economic Geography from the University of Zurich in 2015. During her studies, she stayed for one semester at the University of Aix-Marseille where she experienced protests by the professors and students of the University.


== Political career ==
From 2009 to 2013 she was Vice-President of the Young Socialists of Switzerland. From 2011 to 2015 she was a member of the Grand Council of the Canton of Zurich. In 2015 she was re-elected in her constituency with the best result of her party, but in April 2015, the cantonal party nominated her as a candidate for the 2015 National Council elections. Since the 30 November 2015, she represents the SP in the National Council of Switzerland and resigned as a cantonal councilor. In her first legislature in the National Council she was a member of the Finance Commission and the Immunity Commission of the National Council. In the parliamentary elections in 2019, Meyer was re-elected as a national councilor. In her second legislature she took a seat in the commission for health and social security (SGK) and remained in the immunity commission.

Succeeding Christian Levrat, they were elected on 17 October 2020.


=== Political positions ===
She is a leftwing politician and sees the SP much more defending so called left politics than the European Social Democratic sister parties of the SP. She promotes a welcoming approach towards the asylum seekers which she sees as a normal answer for a country which exports weapons to war zones. During the COVID-19 pandemic she demanded that the Federal and Cantonal (provincial) Governments  announce their measures in a coordinated manner. She defends the liberty of expression and assumed a godparenthood of the Belarusian political activist Anastasiya Mirontsava.


== Personal life ==
Mattea Meyer is the partner of fellow SP politician Patrick Kistler. The couple have two children, a daughter born in 2017 and in 2021.
