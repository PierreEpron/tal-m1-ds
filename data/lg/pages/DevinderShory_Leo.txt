In May 2010, he was named in a lawsuit launched by the Bank of Montreal for an alleged mortgage fraud scheme. Court documents obtained by the CBC allege Shory executed legal transactions misrepresenting the true owner of five separate properties in the Calgary area. The Bank alleges its losses from the scheme at $30 million.Shory responded in a statement on his website "Through media stories, it has come to my attention that I have been named in a civil matter. I want to state that I have not yet been served with a statement of claim. When I am, I will defend myself vigorously against these accusations. I have done nothing wrong...I want to personally thank the many constituents who have already expressed their support for me and for my family."When the Alberta Law Society settled the case with Bank of Montreal on behalf of the 17 lawyers named in the court documents, only four lawyers were sanctioned and Shory was not one of them. Shory is still a practicing lawyer.
