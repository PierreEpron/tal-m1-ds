=== Benazir Bhutto's  Assassination Case ===
Safdar Abbasi and his wife, Naheed Khan, faced many problems after Benazir Bhutto's assassination on December 27, 2007, in Liaquat Bagh. Both were considered close to Benazir Bhutto and sidelined under the new leadership of Asif Ali Zardari, along with her other close advisers.Since Benazir Bhutto's death, many of the party workers who were close to her lost their positions in the Zardari government, including party worker and leader of the lawyers movement in Pakistan Aitezaz Ahsan. Instead, many new figures were introduced to fill these positions.
