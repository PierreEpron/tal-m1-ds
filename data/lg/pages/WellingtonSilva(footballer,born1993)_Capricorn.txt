The deal was delayed until 2011 due to his age.On 28 February 2010, Silva made his senior debut for Fluminense, starting and scoring the second of a 5–1 home routing over Friburguense for the Campeonato Carioca championship; his Série A debut came on 9 May, coming on as a late substitute in a 1–0 loss at Ceará. In October, Silva was widely criticised by coach Muricy Ramalho, after his complaints due to the lack of opportunities, and subsequently appeared rarely after the disruption with his manager.

He scored his first goal for the club in a 2–0 win at Villarreal CF, for the campaign's Copa del Rey.Silva scored his first league goal for Ponfe on 11 November, but in a 5–3 home loss against Córdoba CF.
