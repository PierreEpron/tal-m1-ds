A slow left-arm wrist-spin bowler, Schaw was born in Waipukurau, Central Hawke's Bay District's largest town, and played for Central Districts cricket team since his debut in 2006, featuring in the first class, one day and Twenty20 line-ups. In July 2009 he was purchased by Wellington.Anthony Stuart, Wellington's coach, observed that "Robbie gives us some variation and I think he will thrive on the concentrated training environment we have ... He's bowled well against us in the past, he's a young guy and being a wrist spinner his best years are ahead of him."
