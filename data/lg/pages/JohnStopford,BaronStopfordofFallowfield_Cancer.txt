John Sebastian Bach Stopford, Baron Stopford of Fallowfield KBE FRCS FRCP FRS (25 June 1888 – 6 March 1961) was a British peer, a physician and anatomist, and a Vice-Chancellor of the University of Manchester. Lord Stopford was described as "one of the greatest anatomists of this century".


== Early life and education ==
Stopford was born in Hindley Green near Wigan, UK.  The entry in the registry of births for Wigan, page 92 of volume 8c, 1888, records his birth name as John Sebastian B. Stopford, the son of Thomas Rinch Stopford, a colliery engineer, and his wife Mary (Tyrer) Stopford.  He was educated at Liverpool College and Manchester Grammar School.  He entered to Manchester University in 1906 to read medicine. He graduated with the degrees of Bachelor of Medicine (MB) and Bachelor of Surgery (ChB) in 1911 with honours.


== Early career ==
Having graduated, Stopford went to Rochdale Infirmary as a House Surgeon, and then to Manchester Royal Infirmary as an Assistant Medical Officer. In 1912, he returned to Manchester University as a Junior Demonstrator in Anatomy, working under Prof. Grafton Elliot Smith. He was later promoted to Senior Demonstrator, and received a lectureship in 1915. He also received the degree of Doctor of Medicine (MD) in 1915 with a Gold Medal for a thesis on the supply of blood to the brain.
From 1915 to 1918 during the First World War, he served as a neurologist alongside his lectureship in the military orthopaedic centres.  This was firstly to the Second Western General Hospital and secondly to the Grangethorpe Hospital. He began researching sensation in the peripheral nerves during this time, on a budget from the Ministry of Pensions that obtained for ten years.


== Career progression ==
At just 31 years of age, Stopford was promoted to be Professor of Anatomy at the University of Manchester in 1919 as Prof. Grafton Elliot Smith had moved to University College Hospital in London. During his tenure as Professor, he was Dean of the Medical School twice: between 1923 and 1927, and again between 1931 and 1933. He was also Pro Vice-Chancellor at the university between 1928 and 1930.
Stopford was appointed temporary Vice-Chancellor for six months in 1934 following the departure of Sir Walter Moberly. He made such a success of his time in the post that his appointment was made permanent, and he held it for a total of twenty-two years. He continued as Professor of Anatomy alongside his Vice-Chancellorship until 1938, when he was appointed to a personal Chair in Environmental Neurology.  In 1947 he was appointed the first chairman of the Manchester Regional Hospital Board, which he served until 1953.  He retired in 1956 and was made an emeritus professor.


== Personal life ==
Stopford met Lily Allan while they were both undergraduates at Manchester University. The couple were married in 1916 and they had one son, Thomas Stopford, who died in Rhos on Sea.


== House of Lords ==
In 1958 he was nominated under the terms of Life Peerage Act by the Prime Minister to a receive letters patent, which duly arrived by 5 August. He was created Lord Stopford of Fallowfield and introduced on 10 March 1959 to the House of Lords to sit as a Crossbench peer. However during early retirement he had fallen ill. Lord Stopford never made a speech in the House, dying on 6 March 1961.

== The Stopford Building, University of Manchester ==

The Medical School (1972) was given the name of the Stopford Building in memory of Lord Stopford. It is on Oxford Road, on the corner of Ackers Street, and occupies a very large site. The former Medical Faculty Library housed within the building is now known as the Stopford Library: it is an outlying library of the John Rylands University Library.
