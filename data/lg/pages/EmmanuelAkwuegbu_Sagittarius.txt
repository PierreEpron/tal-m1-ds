== Career ==


=== Germany ===
Chalking up five goals as Stuttgarter Kickers got three points four times in a row leading up to December 2005, Akuwegbu contract ended with the Kickers next July, but engaged in a conflict with them, stating that his contract was still valid until 2007. However, extenuating circumstances allowed the management to officially end the contract. The Nigerian-Austrian then went on to stay with SV Sandhausen until 2008 and SV Elversberg until 2009.


=== India ===
Hitting a hat-trick on his debut as Sporting Clube de Goa put six past Malabar United at the 2010 Indian Federation Cup, the former Lens man was involved in a road accident that fall, causing him to be sidelined and eventually released.
