Mr. Azimov is quoted in the article as saying that Soros' involvement with Sharifov might push the region toward war: “Armenia is interested in war, more so than Azerbaijan. They want to gain further justification of the occupation in Karabakh, so they would be looking for an opportunity to provoke. So war is a possibility but it will only start with a provocation."
