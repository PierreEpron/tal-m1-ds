=== Shrewsbury Town ===
Born in Pontesbury, Shropshire, Edwards started as an apprentice at his hometown club, Shrewsbury Town, and made his professional debut in the final match of 2002–03 season as an 83rd-minute substitute for Jamie Tolley in a 2–1 defeat at home to Scunthorpe United on 3 May 2003, as Shrewsbury were relegated from the Football League.Shrewsbury secured an instant promotion back to the Football League in 2003–04, though Edwards did not play a large role, making just 16 appearances. Upon the club's return to the Football League, Edwards became a regular first-team player, a role he retained for three successive seasons at Gay Meadow.
Towards the end of the 2006–07 season, Edwards was the subject of transfer speculation, after rejecting an offered extension to his Shrewsbury contract. He was then controversially left out of the play-off final against Bristol Rovers by then-manager Gary Peters, despite playing an important role in their run to the final.

He made his debut on the opening day of 2007–08, starting in Luton's 2–1 home win over Hartlepool United. Edwards scored his first goal for Luton with the equaliser in a 2–1 away defeat to Swindon Town a week later.Edwards made 19 league appearances for Luton Town in League One and scored four goals.
