== Career ==
Vasily Shumov's career as a musician, producer and songwriter took start in late 1970s, in the USSR. He organised the rock'n'roll band to play underground music at the local dancing venue of the Moscow suburbs of Korolyov. In early 80s the band, called Center, became extremely popular among youth audience across the former Soviet empire, together with other groups of the "rock and roll revival" scene. Until 1990, Vasily Shumov was occupied both with his career as a frontman of Center and solo (albums, soundtracks, TV and radio, direction and music production for the fellow musicians, like Zvuki Mu). In 1990 Shumov moved to Los Angeles (California, United States), where he lived with his family. He was frequenting Russia, although "the Moscow Times" newspaper featured his "comeback concert" as the only one for the recent eight years (2006) In LA Vasily shot movies and created numerous multimedia art projects, he experimented with innovative ways of music releasing and label production by means of the internet technologies, he also lectured on multimedia art, design and computer.During the first years of the century, Shumov is coordinating the "c-e-n-t-e-r" project, resulted with a series of episodes, where experimental music and videos of many different performers have been combined. The so-called centroborators were contributing for this project through the http and ftp protocols. A movie "Kelton's Dark Corner" (starring Paul Marco, directed by Vasily Shumov) was released in January 2006. But Paul Marco, who is probably best known for the Ed Wood's 1950s films, died during the production, so the planned "Dark Corner" series were never finished
In 2012, Shumov has an idea to create the "Russian White Album", a collection of tracks donated by their copywriters for free. The project was a brainchild of Shumov (rus) The protest anti-Putin set of tracks was described by Shumov himself as a columnist for rbth.com news website (eng)
