== Club career ==


=== PSV ===
Born in Contagem, Minas Gerais, Brazil, Reis started out at Atlético Mineiro's Academy. In October 2006, he went on trial at Eredivisie side PSV Eindhoven and Ajax. After the trial, it was announced two months later that PSV Eindhoven signed Reis on a five–year contract. However, the move will not take effect until July 2007, as he wasn't eighteen at the time of signing for the club. It was also revealed that the club did not pay the transfer fee to sign Reis.


==== 2007–08 season ====
Ahead of the 2007–08 season, Reis was given a number nineteen shirt. He was mentioned by Manager Ronald Koeman about using him in the first team in the 2007–08 season before leaving in October 2007. Reis officially made his PSV Eindhoven debut in the Johan Cruyff Shield against Ajax on 11 August 2007, where he started the match before coming off in the 73rd minute for Género Zeefuik, in a 1–0 loss. Eight days later on 19 August 2007, Reis set up a goal for Ibrahim Afellay, in a 2–0 win over Heracles Almelo. He then made his UEFA Champions League debut on 12 December 2007, coming on as a late substitute, in a 1–0 loss against Inter Milan. However, he spent the rest of the sidelined, due to lack of first team opportunities.


==== 2008–09 season ====
Ahead of the 2008–09 season, Reis suffered a foot injury, causing him to miss PSV Eindhoven's pre-season tour. However, PSV coach Huub Stevens, furious over this 'unprofessional attitude', relegated him to the reserve squad. Stevens was also dismayed by the bad influence of Reis' agent Vlado Lemić. After receiving more disciplinary action for returning too late from a stay in Brazil where he attended his grandmother's funeral, his career at PSV looked over. Fellow Dutch league teams Roda JC and FC Utrecht as well as Portuguese side Vitóia Setúbal showed interest, but Reis stayed at PSV. However, in January 2009 Reis returned to Brazil by joining Tupi for the rest of the season.


==== 2009–10 season ====
In the 2009–10 season, Reis was given a first team chance following a new management of trainer Fred Rutten after he made some impressive pre-season performance. Reis made his first appearance of the 2009–10 season came on 27 August 2009, where he came on as a late substitute, in a 1–0 win over Bnei Yehuda Tel Aviv; winning 2–0 on aggregate to send them through to the group stage. It wasn't until on 12 September 2009 when he made his first league appearance in over a year, coming on as a late substitute, in a 3–0 win over Roda JC. On 17 September 2009, in the Europa league group K match at Sparta Prague, Reis came on as substitute in the 64th minute and scored twice, in a 2–1 win, salvaging a point and becoming an unlikely hero. Then on 23 September 2009, Reis plays his first full match for PSV in the 2–1 Dutch Cup win against first division side De Graafschap. He added three goals throughout October, scoring against Copenhagen, N.E.C. and Roda JC. He added three more goals between 27 November 2009 and 6 December 2009, scoring twice in the league and once in the UEFA Europa League. Since returning to the first team, Reis established himself in the starting eleven at the striker position. On 24 January 2010, however, his contract was terminated after he tested positive for a banned substance and subsequently refused the club's offer of help to treat drug addiction. It was reported that in the case of Reis signing for another club, PSV would file a lawsuit against the player to try to get back some of the money the club had invested in him. Up until his release, Reis made twenty appearances and scoring eight times in all competitions.

Since his release by PSV Eindhoven, Reis spent time at rehab in Brazil for several months. Over the summer, the club were determined to re–sign him. Eventually, on 17 July 2010, Reis re–signed for PSV Eindhoven for the second time, signing a one–year contract, with an option of extending the contract into a three-year deal.


==== 2010–11 season ====
In the 2010–11 season, Reis' first month return saw him out of the first team, as he was not selected in the starting eleven. Instead, he spent his first month return with the club's reserve. The following month, on 16 September 2010, Reis played his first match since re–joining the club, in a UEFA Europa League match against Sampdoria, coming on as a late substitute, in a 1–1 draw. After losing his place over driving under the influence of alcohol, he returned to the first team on 3 October 2010 against VVV-Venlo, scoring twice, in a 3–0 win. This was followed up by scoring against Willem II, Debreceni (scoring once in two separate matches) and Vitesse. Reis also netted a hat-trick against Feyenoord (his first in his professional career) in a 10–0 victory on 24 October 2010. His goal scoring form led suggestion from Piet de Visser that he could earn a place for the FIFA World Cup in Brazil (Reis' nationality) if only he continues to be clean. Due to his goalscoring forms, many people in Eindhoven thought the natural heir to Romário and Ronaldo's momentous heritage had finally arrived. However, in a 2–1 win over FC Utrecht on 7 November 2010, Reis was sent–off mid-way through the first half after elbowing Alje Schut. As a result, he served a two match suspension. Things got bad to worse for Reis when he suffered a serious knee injury during a 3–1 win over Roda JC on 19 December 2010. It was announced that Reis would be out for the rest of the season and never played again. In response to the news, Reis received about 1400 messages from PSV supporters for positive support. Up until his knee injury, he went on to make fifteen appearances and scoring ten times in all competitions. He spent the rest of the season, rehabilitating and having operation on his knee injury.Throughout the 2010–11 season, his contract with PSV ran out despite PSV planning to offer Reis a one-year extension to his expiring deal, but was plagued due to fitness problems, as well as, speculations on whether or not, the contract is being offered on the table yet. However, Reis did not want to settle for anything less than a long-term contract and therefore decided to leave. Following his release from PSV, manager Fred Rutten stated Reis was making good progress in his recovery from a serious knee injury and expected his return to PSV in October. Reis was quoted as being hopeful of returning to PSV Eindhoven on a new deal but the club were not convinced that Reis would fully recover from his knee injury, and opted against offering him a new deal when it was made clear that he wanted to move on.Reis later reflected about his time at PSV Eindhoven and said: "The lifestyle I had at PSV was due to immature behaviour. I was young, alone in the Netherlands and wasn't responsible at that time. I'm not trying to justify using alcohol at that age, but the chance for things to go awry was made possible by the circumstances."


=== Vitesse ===

On 4 December 2011, Reis signed a contract until the end of the 2011–12 season with Vitesse, including an option to extend to extend. His move came after the club had been in the market for attacking reinforcements with Wilfried Bony being away on international duty with Côte d'Ivoire during the Africa Cup of Nations.However, he spent the rest of December, continuously having surgery.

Five days later, on 27 January 2012, Reis was on the bench until coming on for Marcus Pedersen in the 66th minute facing his former club PSV in a 3–1 loss. During the match, he was welcomed back in Eindhoven with bags of powdered sugar being thrown onto the pitch in reference to his struggle with cocaine during his years at PSV.

By April, Reis began to receive a handful of first team football for the side, as he helped Vitesse secure a UEFA Europa League place next season. At the end of the 2011–12 season, he went on to make thirteen appearances for the side in all competitions. On 27 June 2012, Reis signed a new deal with Vitesse, keeping him until 2016.In the 2012–13 season, Reis started the season well when he scored the club's fourth goal of the game, in a 4–4 draw against Lokomotiv Plovdiv in the first leg of the UEFA Europa League Second round.

Then, on 1 September 2013, Reis scored his first league goal for the club, in a 1–1 draw against AZ Alkmaar. However, he was sent to the reserve side by Manager Peter Bosz and explained his actions, saying: "I felt that was necessary, and that has everything to do with the team: if a player places himself outside, I have to intervene, that's what I did, so that's why I temporarily put him back to the promises." The decision also contributed the pair fallen out. Up until then, Reis made five appearances and scoring two times this season so far.

On New Year's Eve of 2015, I decided to change course. I said to my wife, "I stop with alcohol and going out. I'm going to change my life.
