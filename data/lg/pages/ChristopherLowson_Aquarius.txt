Lowson was made a deacon at Petertide on 3 July 1977 and was ordained as a priest the following year, both times by Mervyn Stockwood, Bishop of Southwark, at Southwark Cathedral. He began his ordained ministry as an assistant curate in Richmond, Surrey. He was successively priest in charge (1982 to 1983) and vicar (1983 to 1991) at Holy Trinity, Eltham. From 1982 to 1985 he was also a chaplain at Avery Hill College and then of Thames Polytechnic until 1991. That year, he became vicar of Petersfield and rector of Buriton. He held this appointment for eight years, during the last four of which he was also rural dean of Petersfield. In 1999 he became Archdeacon of Portsmouth, which soon after was divided into the archdeaconries of The Meon and of Portsdown. After the split, Lowson became the Archdeacon of Portsdown and held this position until 2006. In that year he was appointed director of the Ministry Division of the Archbishops' Council and a priest vicar at Westminster Abbey, posts he held until the confirmation of his election to the See of Lincoln.

Lowson's election as Bishop of Lincoln was confirmed at Lambeth Palace on 19 July 2011. He was consecrated as a bishop on 21 September 2011 in Westminster Abbey and enthroned in Lincoln Cathedral on 12 November 2011.

He was introduced to the House of Lords as a Lord Spiritual on 14 September 2017.Following information provided by police, Lowson was suspended from office by Justin Welby, Archbishop of Canterbury, on 16 May 2019. According to Welby, the suspension was in relation to a safeguarding children inquiry, but "is a neutral act" and there has been "no allegation that [he] has committed abuse of a child or vulnerable adult". He accepted a misconduct penalty in relation to his mishandling of "a disclosure about a member of clergy in the Lincoln diocese in early 2019" and returned to work in February 2021.On 31 December 2021, he resigned the See of Lincoln and retired from full-time ministry.
