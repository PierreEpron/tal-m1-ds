== Coaching career ==
In 2000, Bergeron retired from playing professional hockey and returned to his Alma Mater Miami University. He joined the RedHawks as an assistant coach for the 2000–01 season and spent the next 10 seasons with the RedHawks under former teammate and Miami head coach Enrico Blasi. During his time at Miami, Bergeron was part of eight 20-win seasons, including six NCAA Tournament appearances and a national championship game. Bergeron worked with the forwards, as well as being heavily involved in recruiting, bringing in six players who would become All-Americans and another player who would go on to win the Hobey Baker Award at Miami.In 2010, Bergeron was hired as head coach at Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio. Bergeron replaced interim head coach Denis Williams, who took over the struggling program in 2009 after Scott Paluch left to take a position with USA Hockey.In 2014-15, Bergeron led the Falcons to their first 20+ win season since 1995-96, finishing with a record of 23-11-5. They wrapped up that season just .0001 PairWise points on the outside of the national tournament, where they were left out in favor of the eventual national champions that year, Providence.
In 2016-17, after high preseason expectations and sluggish start, he led Bowling Green as they rode a seven-game winning streak all the way to the program's first conference championship game appearance since the 1987-88 season. The Falcons fought valiantly before ultimately dropping the road contest in a hostile environment to Michigan Tech in double overtime, 3-2.
In 2017-18, his Bowling Green Falcons won the Great Lakes Invitational tournament. They triumphed over Michigan Wolverines 6-4 in the semifinals, and they defeated Michigan Tech 4-1 in the championship game, winning the event for the first time in history.
In 2018-19, Bowling Green had a hot stretch to start the season, highlighted by an 8-2 victory over a top-10 Ohio State in Columbus and culminating in finishing the first half of the season with a sweep of then #3 Minnesota State to go into the Christmas break with a 13-3-3 record. Despite their struggles with consistency down the stretch to close the regular season, the Falcons earned a bid to the 2019 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey tournament. They were selected as the 15th seed, which was the last at-large bid to make it into the tournament. Falcons supporters gathered for a "watch party" for the selection show inside the Slater Family Ice Arena as BG earned their first NCAA bid in 29 years.  Bowling Green lost 2-1 in overtime to eventual national champions Minnesota-Duluth in the first round.
On April 5, 2019, Bergeron was named the head hockey coach at Miami University, leaving Bowling Green as the 2nd-winningest coach in program history, with 171 wins.
