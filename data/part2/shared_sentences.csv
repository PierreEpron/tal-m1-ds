"Conrad once wrote ""If anyone has a unique paradise of his own on earth, that one is Mulford Foster, Master of one of the prettiest and wildest valleys in Pennsylvania, he has on his immense primeval estate a limpid lake where wood creatures come down to drink, a magic winding little river for his silent canoe, a collection of almost every variety of domestic animal and bird, pet skunks, several dozen kinds of tamed snakes, wild flowers, trees and shrubs and a million wild creatures that have flocked to his place from the mountains about because they know that no harm can come to them here, and Foster attired in brown flannel and stealing noiselessly through the woods with the light foot and deftness of a Mohican, is all day long and often at evening out among them.""."
"A few of the important landscape projects done between 1925 and 1958 include Lancaster Park, a subdivision in Orlando, FL (1925); the ranch house grounds for Horseshoe Ranch, a 10,000-acre (40 km2) ranch on the Kissimmee River, Florida (1925); the Episcopal Cathedral Church of St Luke downtown Orlando (1925) where he provided the original landscape design (with his son Bert revamping the historic church in 1987); Poinsettia Park in Winter Haven, FL (1926); Ivanhoe Shores, subdivision in Orlando, Fl (1926); Azalea Park, Orlando, FL (1935); The Herlong Estate in Leesburg, FL (1938); The Orlando Garden Club, Orlando, FL (1958); the Floating Islands at Leesburg, FL (1953–1958) during which Foster moved a six trunk date palm from 718 Magnolia to Leesburg."
This begins with the flowering date palm and its maze of thousand spikes or thorns pointing in every direction guarding reproduction from conception to maturing of egg cells that we call seeds or fruit.
"He introduced the brilliant yellow flowering tree, Tabebuia umbellate to North America."
This trip followed the earlier trail of the famous Édouard André to confirm and add to his discoveries 75 years before.
He was invited to lecture in New York on the top of snakes.
"=== Horticulturist/hybridizer ===
Mulford had the reputation of being the first hybridizer of the great self-heading philodendron after bringing it to the US in 1940 and as a hybridizer had extensive demands to maintain."
While living in Cold Springs he maintained a friendship with another writer Conrad Richter.
This was followed in 1954 to Jamaica with his final plant collecting trip made to Mexico in 1957.
"Conrad and his wife lived in Pine Grove, Pennsylvania, which was a nearby town."
The little tendrils and feet of the lowest white leaved vine compared to the little feet of the lizard.
He helped develop the Nyack Country Club in New York between the years 1932-1934.
He and Racine also traveled to Columbia.
Following his death a memorial fund was established at the Marie Selby Botanical Gardens.
He saw the natural arrangements of branches and trunks and this made him think about structure.
His earliest writings came in the form of letters which were abundant even at an early age.
Soon he had made the step from shading photographs to actual painting.
"These paintings were compiled in a book Stokowski Sees that was privately printed but not published and the book is currently held by Michael Spencer who is still deciding on its future, although many drawings and paintings are held by family members from this era and his memories are recollected in memoir accounts."
"A Graflex camera became his constant companion on field trips exploring for snakes, the primary subject on his film of those early days."
"In 1923 he moved his family to Florida and began establishing himself as a well-respected landscaper, first in Palm Beach where he was in charge of landscape design with Exotic Gardens, then moving to Orlando, Florida."
He had painted on canvas but with the painting of his plant subjects he felt closer to the earth if he worked on wood.
"During the presentation they coiled around his neck, found refuge in his pockets or slid inside his shirt against his warm body."
Between the years 1930 and 1935 Mulford's paintings took on a combination of stylized and decorative style.
"During his years at Cold Springs Mulford kept busy on the property developing the former hotel grounds, growing an orchard, raising fruits and vegetables, his reptiles and squab as well as involved in some fashion with the bottling and selling of the spring water which came from underground sources."
He worked as a camp Naturalist and instructor for Camp Kenebec in Maine where he would go in mid-summer.
"During the decades of the 1950s and 1960s while much of Mulford's time was spent exploring, collecting, writing, cultivating, and designing yards he also managed to paint."
tigrina which he crossed in 1946 and it first flowered in 1950.
In 1974 Mulford experienced a devastating cerebrovascular accident leaving him paralyzed on one side and almost always using a wheelchair.
"He was known to many as the ""Snake Man"" having specialized in the reptiles and for that matter all forms of nature for many years."
"Knowing the two individuals, she immediately recommended Mulford who accepted eagerly."
The very young Bali girls perform their ceremonial dances by undulating motion of the arms rather than of the feet or body.
His elephant painting reflects this insight.
"With her inspiration, Mulford grew up making his own small gardens with the wild plants that he had gathered."
The few simple motifs are found repeated in each object with a natural simplicity which the artist has caught and tried to reproduce.
The palm was confined.
"Mulford Bateman Foster (December 25, 1888 – August 28, 1978) was a botanist known by many as the ""Father of the Bromeliad"" as he was instrumental in the discovery and introduction of many new species of Bromeliad to the United States."
"Photographs and news clippings of his accomplishments are among the records at UCF; a large interior tropical garden at the American Mutual Liability Insurance Company, Wakefield, Massachusetts (1957) as well as designed and supervised planting of the grounds of the Clarkstown Country Club, Nyack, NY (1932–1934) and Marine Studios at Marineland, Florida (1937–1938) where he supervised the planting and rock gardens as well as working directly with the building and architects, as well as the engineer."
One popular hybrid was the Billbergia 'Muriel Waterman' (Billbergia horrida var.
These were considered one of the most important bromeliad areas of Latin America.
"The idea of the painting was to build a symphonic interpretation of these motifs from their original primitive representations, reappearing again in living form."
It is the guide for its motivation.
Beginning in the 1940s Mulford along with Racine began publishing their ever-expanding bromeliad knowledge in a wide variety of garden and horticultural publications.
He married Racine Sarasy in 1935 becoming Racine Foster for whom the bromeliad genus Racinaea was named after.
He grew up exploring the woods around his New Jersey home under the guidance of his mother.
The period of details however survived until 1928 when the paintings became more stylized under the tutelage of Leopold Stokowski.
From Brazil he brought back the begonia acetosa and introduced it to US gardeners.
"A special article called ""Puya, the Pineapple's Andean Ancestor"" was published in the October 1950 National Geographic Magazine along with color photos."
His first wife was Fridel Tautenhahn whom he married Nov 1911 in Philadelphia.
"Once he lived in Florida he began taking photos of large estates including their grounds, their gardens, their specimen plants, the vistas as seen through their gates and sold them for extra income."
He required a painting every day from him.
They are among the earliest and simplest forms of plants.
He described the motivation behind the Climbers.
"His wife reported to the newspaper interviewer that ""it just welled up out of him""."
He saw details of leaves and bark.
"Mulford had initially expressed an interest in exploring Dutch Guiana Mulford's and Racine's book Brazil, Orchid of the Tropics, a long out of print book but available through used sources was a well told story of their 1940 trip to Brazil."
One medium that he used and was very skilled was painting in oil on rice pith.
Mulford turned his attention to cultivating and popularizing the bromeliads.
"It is this last series that prompted the name ""passionate plant lover""."
"The New Jersey State Board of Agriculture had realized the value of his work and arranged to send him on a lecture tour around the state to discuss the value of snakes, lizards and turtles at the Farmer's Institutes held at the various counties during the winter shortly after his marriage."
He ultimately held a showing at the Art Center of Maitland in September 1975 exhibiting all his paintings including all the series from the Photographic to the Synthesis.
Mulford also worked elsewhere for extra money.
He had a series of smaller strokes over the next four years before ultimately dying at his home in 1978.
"His early paintings in 1923 were categorized as ""Photographic""."
"The motion of the plant is solidified and has the duration of many years, while the dance of the little girl is observed in but a fleeting glimpse of each movement."
"This experience came about when Stokowski, a long-time friend of Mrs. Bovington, then employing Mulford as a landscape architect for her estate, told her he was looking for someone to accompany the family to Europe."
"He continued to do sketches and smaller works but Palm Family, Orchid Family and Cactus Family were his last serious paintings."
They divorced in 1933 in Florida although the children remained nearby with their mother.
He also devoted his life to hybridizing and contributed widely to the knowledge of the plant species.
"Mulford recollected a number of ""lost"" species during his trips to Brazil."
"He eventually started collecting snakes, lizards and other reptiles whenever he could."
A small tendril is the intelligence part of the vine.
"Some were simple postcards, acknowledgments of his thoughts and yet now providing glimpses into his inner self and a road map to his outward activities."
He wrote quite a bit as well.
"The leaves and flower in the painting represents the family Aracae, of which the calla lily is a member."
The book was a success and its completion brought the artful teamwork that was to mark the relationship between Racine and Mulford.
The owners often voiced the thought that they wished they could be in color as these were the days before color film or digital cameras.
The ornamental form of Euphorbias was a persistent stimulus which produced three important paintings.
"These ranged from well-known venues such as The Smithsonian, The New York Times, and House Beautiful to trade journals such as the National Horticultural Magazine and Cactus and Succulent Journal to name just a few."
"Despite the paralysis, he continued to sketch with his good hand."
"The ""Philosophical"" series was started between 1932 and 1936."
"In Self Defense, every living thing has its own protection."
Lyman ultimately would be of help with the identification and classification of the bromeliads that Mulford would be collecting.
"In the winter he lectured to schools, colleges and Boy Scout groups as well as the YMCA."
It was at this time that he inevitably he saw the wildflowers in fields and forests.
"It was also during this time that they began writing their collaborative books based on travels to South America including Brazil, Orchid of the Tropics, Bromeliads-A Cultural Handbook and Air Gardens of Brazil Mulford also became the founder and President of the Bromeliad Society in 1950 through 1959 and became its editor from 1951 through 1958  and with his editorship of the Bulletin his audience became worldwide."
According to historians the farmhouse likely burned down sometime in 1919 and the family left Cold Springs sometime after this.
He bought as many books on the subject and began teaching himself the art.
In 1939 Mulford set off to Brazil again for six months covering much better known areas than their previous trip.
An unknown artist friend looked at one of his early efforts and made the comment that he did not have to paint every leaf.
"This led to painting the fronds on the frame, extending them up and out of the frame."
"It was remote, connected to services only by a train with a depot near their house and walking path."
He was a charismatic speaker and always pleased his audiences with his enthusiasm and accentuation of humorous and interesting facts.
It was Mulford's great pleasure to explain plant life from his philosophical point of view.
It is Lyman Smith who directed him to Brazil as he had himself been there and collected specimens.
In Mimicry the artist sympathetically depicts the parallel relationship between one of the lizard's mannerisms and that of the Anthurium.
The lake is repeating the line of the arched trunk hanging over it.
Several years later in 1951 he would leave on a Venezuelan plant expedition.
His motive was to teach the audience understanding and acceptance toward snakes.
From that painting forward he made time to paint.
The business of growing and cultivating his plants took hours of his time.
"He had significant influence in the world of bromeliad growers and popularized the use of the term ""pups"" for naming the offshoots of bromeliads."
"Stokowski took him to Switzerland, France and Italy where they spent most of the summer of 1928 in the Alps."
"They had 4 children, Gerda (1912), Bert (1919), Miriam (1920) and then twins with only one daughter Jeanne Eunice surviving (in 1922)."
"He subsequently went to colored pencils which eliminated the need for drying, could be done quickly and simplified the supplies he needed to carry around."
"It was realistic work, always of plants."
"The round form of the orange tree mimicked by the round oranges themselves broken up by the lines of palm fronds, fences and crates."
He wrote numerous pieces for the Bromeliad Journal International which can be found in their archives with an examples frequently seen in reprints even today.
"Between the years 1928-1932 he painted a group of paintings he called ""Stylized""."
This led directly into his early formal painting.
"He was a man of many talents including naturalist, explorer, writer, photographer, artist, horticulturist and a well-respected landscape architect in Florida."
He wasn't able to always capture what he saw and felt on film.
The grouping of leaves each is repeating cleverly the whole form of the lake.
His first painting was a canvas of a garden scene with a wall and large vases.
"Hubbard, a writer and publisher of east Aurora, N.Y. had established a philosophical society which coincided with the developing philosophy held by Mulford."
"Around this same time Mulford met Lyman Smith who was working at Harvard's Gray Herbarium, being referred to him by sources in the Smithsonian."
Between the years of 1908-1918 he enjoyed the great influence of Elbert Hubbard.
Stokowski was the disciplinarian for Mulford.
He worked for 5 years in the top 2 Philadelphia banks during this training and in the year following graduation.
In his Orange Grove painting he used familiar motifs in a highly stylized rendition of orange groves found everywhere at the time in Florida.
He used elephants to move and plow the dirt.
Mulford was again able to find new species in places that were supposedly already previously explored and declared exhausted by prior collectors over the previous one hundred and fifty years.
There were no children from this marriage.
The vine in his painting climbs up the tree trunk for light and air.
In fact the Bali mask in the painting suggests a comparison.
The angular Padilanthus was used as well to compose symphony of harmonious form.
The lizard as well is a very early and simple form of the reptiles.
"The vine and snake are both elemental and early forms of life, assembled in harmonious composition in this painting."
Mulford had a great interest in finding both new and old species of plants that could be used as both indoor decorations and landscape material.
"In the later years, after his move to Florida it was typical that you could find them scribbled on his Tropical Arts letterhead paper."
"== Early life ==
He was born in Elmer, New Jersey to Samuel Preston Foster, Editor of the Elmer Times and Fannie Bateman a housewife with a green thumb and artistic leanings."
To add color he used cotton twisted on a toothpick dipped in paint.
He won a design award for this project in 1953.
"In one, Euphorbia expressed a freer flowing style with its long undulating branches waving as a Bali dancer would, leading to the creation of The Dancers."
It was hung in a Baltimore Show.
"It was almost by the demand of Stokowski that Mulford created over forty impressions of his experience that summer, the major portions being the French Alps in and around Haute Savoir."
He was already renowned as both a Naturalist and lecturer.
In 1962 he received a citation from the American Horticultural Society Congress for contributions to the knowledge of bromeliads.
Mulford tried to show that the plant does the same thing in ten years what the Bali dancer can do in ten minutes.
"This tree is now famous in Orlando, Florida."
"He ran the Tropical Arts Nursery in Orlando, Florida located at 718 N. Magnolia on the corner of Magnolia and Colonial Drive along with the Latch String tea room and his art studio between the years 1924-1957."
From this trip he introduced many new bromeliads and the now famous self-heading philodendrons.
Mulford recalled that his first paintings were done on frosted windowpanes in New Jersey.
"Láinez spent the entire 2004–05 recovering from knee surgery, and ultimately retired from football in May 2005, at only 28."
"Láinez returned to his lifetime club Zaragoza on 9 October 2014, being appointed manager of the reserves."
"He was instrumental in the Aragonese club's immediate promotion, and subsequently helped it finish in a comfortable 12th place, also conquering the Copa del Rey after an extra time win against Real Madrid."
"After his return to Zaragoza, Láinez had to wait until the 2001–02 campaign to become first-choice, but his team would again be relegated."
"== Club career ==
A Real Zaragoza youth graduate, Zaragoza-born Láinez made his professional debut with its B-side, but struggled initially to find a first-team place."
He subsequently became a sports commentator for local TV channels.
"On 19 March 2017 he replaced Raül Agné at the helm of the first team, who now competed in Segunda División."
"He has also stood out for his penalty–stopping abilities throughout his career; with 19 stops in 364 appearances since 2009, he has parried the joint–third–most penalties in Serie A history, behind only Gianluca Pagliuca and Samir Handanović, with 24 stops each."
"The following season, he was loaned to Serie B side Rimini."
Then he was selected by head coach Pierluigi Casiraghi in the squad for the 2007 U-21 Championship as the third choice goalkeeper.
"== International career ==
Consigli made his debut with the Italy U21 squad on 15 August 2006, in a friendly match against Croatia."
"To gain some first team experience, the young goalkeeper was loaned out to Serie C1 side Sambenedettese in the 2006–07 season."
His role model as a goalkeeper is Gianluigi Buffon.
"== Club career ==
Born in Cormano, Consigli is a youth product of Atalanta."
"He took up cycling at the age of 16, receiving his first bike from his half-brother, racing cyclist Jeremy Hunt."
"Joshua James Hunt (born 3 April 1991 in Torquay) is an English former racing cyclist, who rode professionally between 2013 and 2018."
"As a freshman at Colorado in 1998–99 playing under coach Ceal Barry, Lappe led the team in scoring with 10.7 points per game."
She redshirted the next season due to injuring her patella during the home opener.
"== Coaching career ==
Lappe began her coaching career back in Iowa as an assistant at Drake University, a position she held from 2003 to 2006."
"== Early life and education ==
Born in Burlington, Iowa, Lappe grew up in nearby Morning Sun and attended Winfield-Mt. Union High School in Winfield."
"Fisher was considered to have a better understanding of economic matters, was better at handling caucus, had better relations with the party organisation and the unions, and was more in touch with party opinion."
"Fisher's path to Australia was virtually identical to that of Billy Hughes, who had arrived less than a year earlier in December 1884 – both men took assisted passage, arrived at the age of 22, and travelled from London to Brisbane."
"Fisher had originally been opposed to the strike, and unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate a compromise with mine-owners."
A constitutional referendum was initiated in 1911 which aimed to increase the federal government's legislative powers over trade and commerce and over monopolies.
"He would eventually marry his landlady's daughter, Margaret Irvine."
"Fisher subsequently accepted an appointment as the High Commissioner of Australia to the United Kingdom, holding the position from 1916 to 1920."
"The party's leader Frank Tudor had had frequent bouts of ill health, and T. J. Ryan, who was widely seen as Tudor's heir apparent, died suddenly of pneumonia in August 1921."
"During the election campaign he famously declared that Australia would defend Britain ""to the last man and the last shilling""."
"With a majority of seats in the Labour-Protectionist government, Labour caucus by early 1908 had become restive as to the future of the Deakin minority government."
"=== Childhood ===
Fisher spent most of his childhood living in a miners' row, which had an earthen floor and no running water."
"When the Deakin government resigned in 1904, George Reid of the Free Trade Party declined to take office, resulting in Labour taking power and Chris Watson becoming Labour's first Prime Minister for a four-month period in 1904."
"His younger sister died at the age of 10 in 1879, the only one of the siblings not to live to adulthood."
"He lost his seat in 1896 following a campaign in which he was charged by his opponent Jacob Stumm with being a dangerous revolutionary and an anti-Catholic, accusations that were propagated by the newspaper Gympie Times."
The report's conclusions were regarded as insipid with no figures (political or military) heavily censured.
"His decision to retire to England placed him out of the public eye, while his mental deterioration and early death deprived him of the opportunity to dictate his own legacy."
"The Dardanelles Commission, including Fisher, interviewed witnesses in 1916 and 1917 and issued its final report in 1919."
"They rented a property in Highgate for a period, and then in October 1922 bought a home on South Hill Park near Hampstead Heath."
"Unlike Hughes, Fisher never lost his original accent and retained a thick Scottish ""brogue"" for the rest of his life."
He was not only sacked but also blacklisted.
"In 1893, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland as Labour member for the Electoral district of Gympie and by the following year had become Labour's deputy leader in the Legislative Assembly."
"His second government passed wide-ranging reforms – old-age and disability pensions, enshrined new workers' rights in legislation, established the Commonwealth Bank, oversaw the continued expansion of the Royal Australian Navy, began construction on the Trans-Australian Railway, and formally established what is now the Australian Capital Territory."
"He first saw Australia during a stopover at Thursday Island, where whites were a minority and there was a large Japanese population."
"Public reaction to his appointment was positive, with the Brisbane Truth noting it would not change his humble nature: ""To plain Andrew Fisher, who lately refused to-be decorated with empty, unearned University degrees, a Privy Councillorship has been awarded."
"He was later placed in charge of the pit ponies, and finally took his place performing ""pick-and-shovel work"" at the coalface."
"He subsequently became the manager of the foodstore at the local cooperative, and the family moved out of miners' row."
"He was a founding member of the Gympie cooperative, and in 1891 became the secretary of the Gympie Joint Labour Committee, the local labour council."
"Another honour Fisher did accept was appointment to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on his visit to the UK in 1911 for the Coronation of King George V and the Imperial Conference at the same time as New Zealand Prime Minister Sir Joseph Ward and Governor Lord Islington, granting him use of ""The Right Honourable""."
Eligibility for pensions was also widened.
"All six questions were defeated, with around 51 per cent voting 'No'."
"In later life, Fisher recalled attending four schools as a boy."
"Another policy area that captured his attention during this term, was the employment of workers from the Pacific Islands in sugar plantations, a practice that Fisher and Labour both strongly opposed."
The pair met frequently to discuss politics and would renew their acquaintance later in life.
"Hughes asked Fisher for support by cable three weeks before the first referendum, but Fisher cabled back ""Am unable to sign appeal."
The first complete biographies of Fisher did not emerge until the 100th anniversary of his prime ministership.
"In 1992, his home in Gympie (Andrew Fisher's Cottage) was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register."
The 113 acts passed in the three years of the second Fisher government exceeded even the output of the second Deakin government over a similar period.
"In his maiden speech, he pushed for a 50% decrease in military spending and declared support for a federation."
"By 1928, he was unable to sign his own name, and his children were seriously considering having him institutionalised."
"Fisher and Hardie were leaders of the 1881 Ayrshire miners' strike, which was widely seen as a failure."
"Clem Lloyd also began a biography in the 1990s, which was unfinished at the time of his death in 2001."
"The 1896 establishment of the Gympie Truth, a newspaper that he was to partly own, was part of his response."
The federal electorate of Fisher was named after him.
"He obtained an engine-driver's certificate in 1891, and was elected president of the related craft union."
"No coalition was formed, however the pressure from Labour brought about productive change by Deakin: he agreed to a royal commission into the post office, old-age pensions were to be provided from the surplus revenue fund and £250,000 set aside for ships for an Australian Navy."
"He settled in Gympie, Queensland, and in 1893 was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly as a representative of the Labor Party."
"Fisher's father then worked as a gardener and apiarist, supplementing his income with contract work repairing the machinery at local mines."
"He was the second of eight children born to Jane (née Garven or Garvin) and Robert Fisher; he had one older brother, four younger brothers, and two younger sisters."
"In 1884, he chaired a public meeting in Crosshouse in support of the Third Reform Bill."
"The Fisher government carried out many reforms in defence, finance, transport and communications, and social security, achieving the vast majority of their aims in just three years of government."
"Prospering financially for the first time in his life, he built a timber cottage at Howard and began investing in shares."
"When he was 16, he was promoted to air-pump operator, which required additional training and was seen as a relatively prestigious position."
"The 1910–13 Fisher government represented the culmination of Labour's involvement in politics, and was a period of reform unmatched in the Commonwealth until the 1940s, under John Curtin and Ben Chifley."
"In political terms he was a radical, on the left-wing of his party, with a strong sense of Labour's part in British working-class history."
"The exact age at which Fisher left school is uncertain, but he could have been as young as nine or as old as thirteen."
"He helped establish a branch of the Workers' Political Association, the forerunner of the Labor Party, and was the inaugural branch president with George Ryland as secretary."
"By the time he was 60, Fisher's family and friends had begun to notice a decline in his mental faculties, which was probably a form of early-onset dementia."
"The First World War had broken out in the middle of the 1914 election campaign, with both sides committing Australia to the British Empire."
"These included extending old-age and disability pensions, introducing a maternity allowance and issuing Australia's first paper currency, forming the Royal Australian Navy, the start of construction of the Trans-Australian Railway, expanding the bench of the High Court of Australia, the founding of Canberra, and the establishment of the state-owned Commonwealth Bank."
"This gave Labour control of both upper and lower houses and enabled Fisher to form his Second Fisher Ministry, Australia's first elected federal majority government, Australia's first elected Senate majority, and the world's first Labour Party majority government."
"The introduction of the maternity allowance was a major reform, because it enabled more births to be attended by doctors, thus leading to reductions in infant mortality rates."
"Fisher contracted a severe case of influenza in September 1928, and eventually died from complications of the disease on 22 October, aged 66."
"He is one of only three Australian prime ministers to die overseas, and he and George Reid are the only ones who both began and ended their lives outside Australia."
"Fisher moved to the larger gold-mining town of Gympie in 1888, initially working in the No. 1 North Phoenix mine and then in the South Great Eastern Extended."
"Fisher campaigned on Labor's record of support for an independent Australian defence force, and pledged that Australia would ""stand beside the mother country to help and defend her to the last man and the last shilling""."
"George Reid adopted a strategy of trying to reorient the party system along Labour vs non-Labour lines – prior to the 1906 election, he renamed his Free Trade Party to the Anti-Socialist Party."
"Writers interested in the post-Federation era did not generally view him as an attractive biographical subject, which has been attributed to the relative orthodoxy of his political views and a reputation for propriety to the point of dullness."
"This new job allowed him to work above-ground, operating the machinery that raised and lowered the cages in the mineshaft."
"He is believed to have begun his working life as a coal trapper, opening and closing the trapdoors that allowed for ventilation and the movement of coal."
Fisher was buried at Hampstead Cemetery on 26 October 1928.
"At the end of 1901, Fisher married Margaret Irvine, his previous landlady's daughter."
"Ramsay MacDonald, Britain's first Labour Prime Minister, unveiled a memorial to Fisher in Hampstead Cemetery in 1930."
"During his time in Gympie, Fisher stayed in a boardinghouse in Red Hill; it is now heritage-listed as ""Andrew Fisher's Cottage""."
"He explored the possibility of standing for the British House of Commons, but eventually opted for a permanent retirement from politics."
"The standard of public education in Scotland was relatively high at the time, and his schoolmaster in Crosshouse had received formal training in Edinburgh; the main focus of the curriculum was on the three Rs."
"Fisher stood for the Division of Wide Bay at the inaugural 1901 Australian federal election and won the seat, which he held continuously for the rest of his political career."
"After arriving in Brisbane, Fisher made his way to the Burrum River coalfields where there were already a number of Scottish miners."
Fisher's mother was the daughter of a blacksmith and worked as a domestic servant.
"In 1901, Fisher was elected to the new federal parliament representing the Division of Wide Bay."
"He was unwilling to actively campaign for preselection, and decided he would only stand if he were drafted; this did not eventuate."
Fisher established and demonstrated his ministerial capabilities as Minister for Trade and Customs in the Watson Ministry.
"However, beginning in the 1970s a different view of Fisher began to emerge, which coincided with more of his personal papers becoming available to researchers."
"His more recent biographers have credited Fisher with establishing Labor as a viable party of government and demonstrating that the party's platform did not have to be sacrificed for political expediency, and argued that he deserves the primary credit for the political and electoral accomplishments of his governments."
"In October 1915, journalist Keith Murdoch reported on the situation in Gallipoli at Fisher's request, and advised him, ""Your fears have been justified""."
"Fisher wanted additional Commonwealth power in certain areas, such as the nationalisation of monopolies."
"He was athletic, helping form a local football team, and stood 178 centimetres (5 ft 10 in) as an adult, above the average at the time."
"He was the only remaining former prime minister in the Labor Party, which had lost many experienced MPs in the 1916 party split."
"He was the Minister for Trade and Customs for a few months in 1904, in the short-lived government of Chris Watson."
"He initially provided support to the minority government of Protectionist leader Alfred Deakin, but in November 1908 the ALP withdrew its support and Deakin resigned as prime minister."
"This is an honor to which our Prime Minister is justly entitled by reason of his inclusion in the secret councils of the Imperial Conference, which secrets include the private advice, tendered by him to the administrators of and in the administration of his Majesty's Imperial Government."""
"As a boy, Fisher and his brothers fished in Carmel Water, a tributary of the River Irvine, and enjoyed long walks across the countryside."
In 1972 he was honoured on a postage stamp bearing his portrait issued by Australia Post.
"Like many miners, Fisher was a supporter of Gladstone's Liberal Party, in particular the ""Liberal-Labour"" candidates who had the support of the unions."
"On his father's side, he was descended from a long line of Ayrshire coalminers."
"He continued his involvement in unionism, helping form the Gympie branch of the Amalgamated Miners' Association (AMA) and serving terms as secretary and president."
"However, he struggled with the demands of Australia's participation in World War I and in October 1915 resigned in favour of his deputy Billy Hughes."
Fisher resigned as Prime Minister and from Parliament on 27 October 1915 after being absent from parliament without explanation for three sitting days.
"Fisher immigrated to Australia in 1885, where he continued his involvement with trade unionism."
"They later lived in Kilmaurs for a period, but eventually returned to Crosshouse and leased a small farm."
"He was kicked in the head by a cow as a small child, leaving him mostly deaf in one ear."
"In 2008, Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, a fellow Queenslander, launched a biography titled Andrew Fisher, written by David Day."
"He lost his job, but soon found work at a different mine."
"Reid envisaged a spectrum running from socialist to anti-socialist, with the Protectionist Party in the middle."
"When Watson resigned in 1907, Fisher succeeded him as Labour leader, although Hughes and William Spence also stood for the position."
"The exact details are uncertain, but he is known to have finished his schooling in Crosshouse and to have attended a school in nearby Dreghorn for a period."
"He began as an ordinary miner and joined the local miners' union, but after successfully sinking a new shaft at Torbanlea, he was employed as a mine manager."
"=== Third term (1914–1915) ===
Labor retained control of the Australian Senate despite defeat."
"From December 1912 onwards, naturalised residents no longer had to wait three years to be eligible for a pension."
Fisher supported the White Australia policy but also argued that any Kanaka who had converted to Christianity and married should be allowed to remain in Australia.
"On the same day, a memorial service was held at St Columba's Church, London, which was attended by representatives of King George V and Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, as well as Arthur Henderson representing the British Labour Party."
A memorial garden was also dedicated to Fisher at his birthplace in the late 1970s.
"In February 1930, Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald unveiled a granite obelisk above Fisher's grave."
"This time, he was the beneficiary of a scare campaign, in which conservative candidate Francis Power was consistently painted by the Gympie Truth as being a supporter of black labour and the alleged economic and social ills that accompanied it."
He did not share Hughes' passion for free trade or that of Watson and Hughes for defence (and later conscription).
"The Fisher government made another attempt, holding a referendum in 1913 which asked for greater federal powers over trade and commerce, corporations, industrial matters, trusts, monopolies, and railway disputes."
"In 1911 Fisher declined the offer of honorary degrees from the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, Glasgow and Birmingham, although he did accept the Freedom of the City from the cities of Glasgow, Edinburgh and Bristol."
"The report was also used by the Dardanelles Commission on which Fisher served, while High Commissioner in London."
"Although he was probably only partially literate, Fisher's father was prominent in the local community and involved with various community organisations."
"Fisher seriously considered standing in the resulting by-election, but found there was no guarantee that the local party would accept him as a candidate."
"In addition, the age at which women became entitled to the old-age pension was lowered from sixty-five to sixty."
"In May 1909, the more conservative Protectionists and Freetraders merged to form the Commonwealth Liberal Party, while the more liberal Protectionists joined Labour."
The injury may have contributed to a childhood speech impediment and his reserved nature as an adult.
"Fisher's father had black lung disease, and gave up mining around the same time as his oldest sons began working."
"He was also active in the Amalgamated Miners Union, becoming President of the Gympie branch by 1891."
"Writing for The Australian Worker, Henry Ernest Boote praised him as ""loyal to his class, courageous in the advocacy of their cause, and absolutely incorruptible""."
He subsequently wrote a letter to Gladstone and received a reply thanking him for his support.
"The following year, Fisher was involved in another miners' strike."
"With little else to keep them in Australia, Fisher and his wife decided to return to London to be closer to their children."
"He was praised for successfully managing the conflicting personalities within his own party, but as a leader of his country was often compared unfavourably with Deakin and Hughes."
Fisher and his party were immediately underway in organising urgent defence measures for planning and implementing Australian war effort.
"This was Australia's first double dissolution election, and the only one until the 1951 election."
Fisher was elected deputy leader of the ALP in 1905 and replaced Watson as leader in 1907.
"He left school at a young age to work in the nearby coal mines, becoming secretary of the local branch of the Ayrshire Miners' Union at the age of 17."
"After a brief return to Australia, he retired to London, dying there at the age of 66."
"He was the leader of a temperance society, and in 1863 was one of ten miners who co-founded a cooperative society."
The ten-week strike resulted in only a small pay rise rather than the 10 percent that had been asked for; many workers depleted their savings and some cooperatives came close to bankruptcy.
"It was judged unsafe for him to be out alone in public, and in 1925 his assets were placed in trust."
"After just over a year in office, Cook was forced to call a new election, the first double dissolution."
"Compulsory preference to trade unionists in federal employment was also introduced, while the Seaman's Compensation Act of 1911 and the Navigation Act of 1912 were enacted to improve conditions for those working at sea, together with compensatory arrangements for seamen and next of kin."
His biographer David Day has speculated that this initial first impression may have contributed to his later opposition to non-white immigration.
Fisher subsequently formed a minority government of his own.
"Labour improved their position at the 1903 election, gaining enough seats to be on par with the other two, a legislative time colloquially known as the ""three elevens""."
"Andrew Fisher (29 August 1862 – 22 October 1928) was an Australian politician who served as the fifth prime minister of Australia, from 1908 to 1909, 1910 to 1913, and 1914 to 1915, holding office as the leader of the Australian Labor Party (ALP)."
"According to family tradition, his paternal grandfather was persecuted for his involvement in the fledgling union movement, and on one occasion was left homeless with five young children."
"A land tax, aimed at breaking up big estates and give wider scope for small-scale farming, was also introduced, while coverage of the Arbitration system was extended to agricultural workers, domestics, and federal public servants."
"Within years of arriving in the town, Fisher had become ""an important figure in the Gympie labour movement, straddling both its political and industrial wings""."
"New Protection was declared invalid by the High Court in June, Fisher found the tariff proposals of Deakin unsatisfactory, while caucus was also dissatisfied with the old-age pension proposals."
"Fisher visited Australian troops serving in Belgium and France in 1919, and later presented Pearce with an album of battlefield photos from 1917 and 1918, showing the horrendous conditions experienced by the troops."
"It concluded that the expedition was poorly planned and executed and that difficulties had been underestimated, problems which were exacerbated by supply shortages and by personality clashes and procrastination at high levels."
"He soon came into contact with Keir Hardie, a leading figure in the union and a future leader of the British Labour Party."
"Fisher's 1981 entry in the Australian Dictionary of Biography was written by Denis Murphy, who had planned a full-length biography but died in 1984 before completing it."
"Fisher passed this report on to Hughes and to Defence Minister George Pearce, ultimately leading to the evacuation of the Australian troops in December 1915."
"In general, his prime ministership was seen as a relatively inconsequential interlude."
"Fisher returned as prime minister after the 1910 Australian federal election, which saw Labor attain majority government for the first time in its history."
"Intended as a medium to broadcast Labour's message, the newspaper played a vital role in Fisher's return to parliament in 1899."
"Both questions were defeated, with around 61 per cent voting 'No'."
"In 1892, he represented Gympie at the Labour-in-Politics Convention in Brisbane."
"Although admitted as a Privy Counsellor in absentia on 6 July 1911, it wasn't until 14 February 1916 when he was High Commissioner in London that he formally took his oath of office."
"He arrived back in Melbourne with no firm plans for his future, but the rapturous receptions he received at labour movement gatherings led him to contemplate a return to active politics."
"Labor won back its majority in the House, and Fisher returned for a third term as prime minister."
"Fisher was born in Crosshouse, Ayrshire, Scotland."
He later supplemented his limited formal education by attending night school in Kilmarnock and reading at the town library.
"In the decades after his death, a general view emerged of Fisher as a competent rather than brilliant leader."
"With the Deakin ministry in trouble, Deakin spoke to Fisher and Watson about a possible coalition, and following a report agreed to it providing Labour had a majority in cabinet, that there was immediate legislation for old-age pensions, that New Protection was carried and that at the following election the government would promise a progressive land tax."
"Wartime legislation in 1914 and 1915 included the War Precautions acts (giving the Governor-General power to make regulations for national security), a Trading with the Enemy Act, War Census acts, a Crimes Act, a Belgium Grant Act, and an Enemy Contracts Annulment Act."
"He was confirmed by the United States Senate on December 10, 1906, and received his commission the same day."
"He was in private practice in Hastings from 1875 to 1888, also serving as a prosecuting attorney of Barry County, Michigan from 1879 to 1883."
"His service terminated on February 8, 1910, due to his elevation to the Sixth Circuit."
"== Education and career ==
Born in Hastings, Michigan, Knappen received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Michigan in 1873 and read law to enter the bar in 1875, thereafter receiving an Master of Arts degree from the University of Michigan in 1876."
He was a Commissioner for the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan from 1880 to 1888.
"Knappen was nominated by President William Howard Taft on January 17, 1910, to a joint seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and the United States Circuit Courts for the Sixth Circuit vacated by Judge Horace Harmon Lurton."
"He assumed senior status on April 15, 1924."
"He was confirmed by the Senate on January 31, 1910, and received his commission the same day."
He was a member of the Conference of Senior Circuit Judges (now the Judicial Conference of the United States) from 1922 to 1923.
"On December 31, 1911, the Circuit Courts were abolished and he thereafter served only on the Court of Appeals."
"== Biography ==
In 1990, Fensterbank graduated as chemical engineer from Ecole Supérieure de Chimie Industrielle de Lyon, now École Supérieure de Chimie Physique Électronique de Lyon."
"== Research ==
Louis Fensterbank's research objectives deal with the invention of synthetic methods by means of three interconnected themes: radical chemistry, organometallic catalysis and organosilicon chemistry."
Louis Fensterbank is a French scientist specialized in molecular chemistry.
"== Awards ==
In 2008, Louis Fensterbank was nominated junior member of Institut Universitaire de France, of which he became a senior member in 2021."
"He was awarded the Clavel Lespiau Prize of the French Academy of Sciences in 2014, the Prize of the Division de Chimie Organique of the Société chimique de France in 2016, and the Silver Medal of the French National Centre for Scientific Research in 2017."
"His contribution in organometallic catalysis has focused on the electrophilic activation of π-systems by gold or platinum complexes, which allows expedient access to polycyclic systems from polyunsaturated substrates and can be applied to the total synthesis of complex terpenes."
He obtained his PhD in 1993 at the State University of New York at Stony Brook under the guidance of Scott Sieburth.
Photoredox versions of these processes have been devised.
"These studies have also stimulated the development of new redox systems based on the oxidation of anions (enolates, trifluoroborates and silicates)."
He developed original radical processes using new partners that lead to complex molecular systems.
== References ==
"In the context of a ""greener"" radical chemistry, new radical promotors have been invented."
"Following a lecturer position at the Pierre and Marie Curie University (UPMC), he was appointed in 1995 by the French National Centre for Scientific Research as a chargé de recherche with Max Malacria."
"Mechanistic studies, as well as the development of enantioselective versions of these reactions have accompanied these works."

Reflecting upon the scepticism created by incidents of doping, she said ""You have to accept the situation...it would be great if we could win the battle against doping and have testing that was 100 per-cent reliable, but I don't think that will happen in my competitive career."""
Radcliffe claimed back to back World Cross Challenge wins at Durham and Mallusk to start the 1994 season.
"In 2015, in the wake of revelations of widespread doping in athletics, Radcliffe said that, unlike some other prominent British athletes, she would not be releasing her blood-test history, and discouraged other athletes from doing so."

"Radcliffe managed to get to fitness level for the 2008 Summer Olympics, but cramped during the marathon to the point where she had to stop running and stretch."
"At the age of 10 Radcliffe, accompanied by her father, watched Ingrid Kristiansen run in the London Marathon, inspiring her to become an athlete."
"In response, Radcliffe issued a statement in which she ""categorically denied"" cheating in any form and said she has ""nothing to hide""."
She set the 2011 Berlin Marathon as her comeback venue to try for an Olympic qualifying time.

"At the Great North Run, Radcliffe ran a new European record for the half marathon, as she won the race in a time of 67 minutes and 7 seconds."
He took up the hobby again in an attempt to lose weight after giving up smoking.
"Radcliffe went on to win the New York City Half Marathon in 1:09:45, two seconds off the course record."
"However, she suffered an injury to her leg just two weeks prior to the event and had to use a high dose of anti-inflammatory drugs."
She came third in the race with a time of 2:23:46 hours – getting the Olympic standard and the fourth fastest time by a European that year.
"She gave birth to her first child, daughter Isla, in 2007."
Paula Jane Radcliffe MBE (born 17 December 1973) is a former British long-distance runner.
Radcliffe was initially misdiagnosed with the injury which forced her to miss all of 1994 and thought about quitting as the injury would not get better.
"The race is remembered for a notorious moment towards the end when Radcliffe, hindered by runner's diarrhea and in need for a toilet break, stopped and defecated on the side of the road in view of the crowd and TV cameras which broadcast the incident live."
"Radcliffe attended Frodsham Athletic Club until the age of nine, Radcliffe became a member of Bedford & County Athletics Club, when they moved to Oakley."

Despite suffering from asthma Radcliffe took up running at the age of seven.
"However, Radcliffe soon returned to the track for the first time since March after a virus, a knee operation and a calf muscle tear had kept her out; to race over 1,500 metres in Barcelona."
Radcliffe then sustained a knee injury.
"Radcliffe called the performance ""a bit of a disaster"", and indicated she was suffering from a tear in one of the discs of her back."
"At the European Cup Radcliffe, captaining the team, won the 5,000 metres and finished second in the 1500 metres."
"Radcliffe is a former world champion in the marathon, half marathon and cross country."
I started feeling it between 15 and 16 miles (26 km) and probably carried on too long before stopping.
"=== 2004 Athens Olympics ===
Radcliffe did not compete in the London Marathon in 2004, but was the favourite to win a gold medal in the marathon at the Olympic Games in Athens."
"Radcliffe had dropped out of Durham's cross country race with flu at the start of 1998, but bounced back to finish third in Dublin."
The sign was made by Radcliffe's husband and read 'EPO Cheats Out'.
The pair married in 2001.
"== Anti-doping activity ==
Radcliffe has frequently made high-profile condemnations of the use of performance-enhancing drugs in athletics."
"This had an adverse effect on her stomach, hindering food absorption."
"Radcliffe set the pace in the 10,000 metres at the European Championships, but finished fifth."
"She was dissatisfied, however, saying: ""I'm not particularly happy, either with my time or my place."

"== Personal life ==
Radcliffe was born to Peter and Pat Radcliffe and is the grandniece of 1920 Olympic silver medallist Charlotte Radcliffe."
Radcliffe was diagnosed with exercise induced asthma at the age of 14 after blacking out whilst training.
She was later indirectly identified as a suspected doper by MP Jesse Norman during a parliamentary inquiry into blood doping.
She announced that the New York City Half Marathon would be a testing ground for her fitness before the competition.
Radcliffe finished second behind US runner Kara Goucher.
"Shortly afterwards, her three suspect test results were leaked, though Radcliffe still refused to release her complete blood-test history."
"Radcliffe won the 2008 Great South Run in 51 minutes 11 seconds, 11 seconds off of Sonia O' Sullivan's course record."
"There she was coached by Alex Stanton, who still fulfilled that role in her professional career."
Radcliffe was then selected for the 2000 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships in Mexico.
Her family then moved to nearby Barnton where she attended Little Leigh Primary School.
"Russian Lyudmila Petrova came in second, and American Kara Goucher took third."
"Radcliffe and teammate Hayley Tullett caused controversy when, in the heats of the 5,000 metres at the 2001 World Athletics Championships in Edmonton, they held up a sign protesting against the reinstatement of Russian athlete Olga Yegorova after Yegorova had tested positive for the banned substance EPO."
"Radcliffe, who was suffering from a virus, took some time off, before returning to the cross country discipline, where she won her first senior title by taking the European Long course race."
"It was eventually taken off them by the stadium officials, but not before it was streamed around the world."
"In her first senior race, in Durham at the start of 1993, Radcliffe finished second to Olympic Champion Derartu Tulu."
"Catherine Ndereba of Kenya finished in second place, more than a minute behind."

In 2004 Radcliffe joined with Jonathan Edwards on an Olympic Special Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?.
She ended up withdrawing from the race after 36 km (22 mi).
To come here and receive this and to meet the Queen at the end of it just finishes it off perfectly.
Radcliffe returned to action by winning the BUPA Ireland five-mile race.
This was her first race in almost two years.
"At the World championships, Radcliffe qualified comfortably for the final of the 5,000 metres, where she finished fifth."
Radcliffe became the first woman to defend the Fifth Avenue Mile title.
Her comeback was further delayed in 2007 as a result of a stress fracture in her lower back.
"In late November 2015, the IAAF declared that the accusations were ""based on the gross misinterpretation of incomplete data""."
"On the track, Radcliffe won the 10,000 metres silver medal at the 1999 World Championships and was the 2002 Commonwealth champion at 5000 metres."
"She was previously the fastest female marathoner of all time, and held the Women's World Marathon Record with a time of 2:15:25 for 16 years from 2003 to 2019 when it was broken by Brigid Kosgei."
"""Later the same year, she became the BBC Sports Personality of the Year, making her the first woman in over a decade to be honoured with the accolade."
"There Radcliffe defeated Tulu by seventy-five seconds, in eight inches of snow."
"She said: ""It means a great deal to me, it's a great honour and it really tops off an amazing year."
"In the 1997 World Championships, Radcliffe finished in 4th place over the 5,000 metres."
It is likely that the first suspicious off-score was caused by faulty equipment.
"Radcliffe then ran the seventh fastest 10,000 metres ever at the European 10,000 metres challenge."
Stanton started to coach Radcliffe at the age of 12 after his wife Rosemary spotted her talent.
"If somebody had been with me at the end I think I could have pushed it up a bit more."""

"Shortly after the London Marathon, it was also revealed that Radcliffe was suffering from an injury to her hip, preventing her from running."
"Radcliffe's father became club vice-chairman and her mother, a fun-runner, managed the women's cross-country team."
"In January 2015, Radcliffe announced that she had decided to end her marathon career on 26 April 2015 by competing in the 2015 London Marathon."
"After Radcliffe and Tullett's initial protest, teammates Kathy Butler and Hayley Yelling – who both missed out on a place in the final – protested alongside coaches Mark Rowland and Alan Storey, wearing Radcliffe masks and holding up banners with mocking slogans including one which read 'Free Paula'."
"At the London Grand Prix, Radcliffe took two seconds off her own British record in the 5,000 metres."
"=== Further world records ===
Radcliffe set her last women's marathon world record during the 2003 London Marathon in April, with a time of 2:15:25."
"After the race, she apologised to viewers and explained what happened, ""I was losing time because I was having stomach cramps and I thought 'I just need to go and I'll be fine'."
"Radcliffe then ran the second fastest half marathon by a British woman, finishing third on her debut at the distance at the Great North Run, despite getting into a tangle with a spectator."
"However, she felt that in cases like that of Christine Ohuruogu, who missed three out-of-competition drugs tests, that she should be allowed to compete in the Olympics, as the BOA does not allow anyone who has served a doping ban to compete."
"For the European Cup, Radcliffe joined a host of other British athletes by pulled out injured."
Radcliffe set a new world best for 5 miles (8.0 km) on the road around Balmoral Castle.
"At the 1996 Securicor Games Radcliffe ran the 5,000 metres finishing second."
She was awarded an MBE in June 2002.
"Her second child, a son, Raphael, was born in 2010."

"According to the nine-year-old Freeborn Garrettson, these were audible requests from God."
He entered the Methodist ministry in 1775 and travelled extensively to evangelize in several states.
"Garrettson wrote that a ""voice"" moved him to do so."
"The instruction focused on basic reading, writing, and arithmetic, but also included bookkeeping, surveying and astronomy."
"Among other areas that he opened to Methodism was Shelburne, Nova Scotia."
"His journals divulge an anti-slavery stance, but do not reveal the extent of his activism."
"Garrettson wrote on the issue of slavery, including a published work, ""A Dialogue Between Do-Justice and Professing Christian."""
Garrettson ranged widely throughout Nova Scotia and preached in almost every settlement in the colony.
"He was called Methodism's ""Paul Revere""."
A wave of voluntary emancipation mirrored and followed Garrettson's time on the Delmarva peninsula.
The curriculum was rich in religious and social principles.
"=== Role in American Methodism ===
Kenneth E. Rowe's foreword to the book American Methodist Pioneer, which presents Garrettson's journals, begins,""Freeborn Garrettson was unquestionably the most competent native born Methodist preacher in the American colonies in the founding period."
"His preaching against slavery resulted in his being thrown in jail in Cambridge, Maryland."
"The Garrettson family owned a large amount of land which included a farm, a general store, and a blacksmith shop."
"In a series of events, he lost his mother, his sister Sally, and two family servants."
"Although he favored the revolutionary cause, he refused to fight in the American Revolution and was placed in jail for a time in Maryland."
"Early in his career, he served the faithful of the Delmarva Peninsula."
He held the first Methodist church services in the Benner House on Mill Street.
"Despite the stellar efforts of these traveling preachers, the completion of the conversion to Christianity of Freeborn Garrettson would not be complete until the active mentoring of the British itinerant, Francis Asbury."
"== Early life ==
Born in 1752 on the west side of the Chesapeake Bay at the mouth of the Susquehanna River in Maryland, what is known today as Bush River Neck, Freeborn Garrettson was the third generation in his family to live there."
"The question stirs my heart."""
"""Garrettson first became a Methodist preacher in 1775."
"After his ""knowing what a saint is"" episode, he writes in a journal that he ""saw such a person, the most beautiful of any I had ever beheld, I...prayed to the Lord to make me a saint."
Garrettson's preaching ranged from North Carolina to Nova Scotia.
"Freeborn Garrettson (August 15, 1752 – September 26, 1827) was an American clergyman, and one of the first American-born Methodist preachers."
Growing up in a wealthy Anglican family allowed young Garrettson to receive a proper education for the offspring of well-to-do farmers by the standards of the time.
"""Shortly after these supernatural happenings at the age of 10, Freeborn Garrettson faced tragedy."
Who was asking?
After settling in New York Garrettson continued to be a Methodist circuit rider.
"Just prior to the question of knowing what a saint is, he experiences another audible event."
He followed in the wake of Henry Alline and focused much of his work on the areas where Alline had previously spread Methodism.
A saint is one who is wholly given up to God.'

"During Drapeau's tenure as mayor, he initiated the construction of the Montreal Metro mass transit subway system with trains running on whisper quiet rubber wheels, Place des Arts, and Expo 67, the universal exposition of 1967."
"He ran an exceptionally wide-flung campaign, uniting a large coalition of voters from English-speaking and French-speaking parts of Montreal."
Drapeau also secured the hosting of the 1976 Summer Olympics and was instrumental in building the Olympic Stadium and then world's tallest inclined tower.
"""Drapeau said ""The Olympics can no more lose money than a man can have a baby,"" after announcing the budget for the Montreal Olympic games."
The inquiry found that Drapeau had made some serious and costly mistakes.
"Major accomplishments of the Drapeau Administration include the development of the Montreal Metro entirely underground mass transit subway system running on 'whisper quiet' rubber wheels, a successful international exposition Expo 67 as well as the construction of a major performing arts centre, the Place des Arts."
"When Camillien Houde retired as mayor of Montreal, Drapeau was well poised to succeed him."
"If you want to ensure something gets done, the best way is to do it yourself."
"His father, an insurance broker, city councilor and election worker for the Union nationalecode: fra promoted to code: fr , introduced him to politics."
He began his practice as a criminal lawyer in Montreal in 1944.
"During the Asbestos strike of 1949, he took on the legal defence of some of the strikers."
He was also a Bloc populairecode: fra promoted to code: fr  candidate in the 1944 provincial election but was badly defeated in his Montreal constituency.
"In 1945, he married Marie-Claire Boucher."
Cost overruns and scandals forced the Quebec government to take over the project eight months before the Games opened.
"Following the Olympics, the city was left with a debt of $1 billion, leading to the Aislin editorial cartoon of a pregnant Drapeau calling Canadian physician and abortion rights advocate Henry Morgentaler."
The 1970s were busy times for the preparation of the 1976 Summer Olympics.
"In 1942, he ran as a candidate of the nationalist Bloc populairecode: fra promoted to code: fr , which opposed Canadian conscription during World War II, in a federal by-election."
"In 1967, Drapeau was made a Companion of the Order of Canada and received the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada's gold medal."

Monti also considered entering the religious life and joined the order of Lodovico Pavoni for a brief period of time though became a religious of his own order later on.
In 1882 he met a Carthusian monk who came to see him at the hospital in Rome and at his request assumed care for his four parentless nephews; he opened a home for them at Saronno after he arrived there.
He made a private vow of obedience and to remain chaste to God on 8 December 1846.
The religious left Rome in 1886 and moved to Saronno.
The pope desired Monti's order to be aggregated to the Capuchin order - since Monti worked with them for a brief period of time - but Cardinal Luigi Bilio sent a letter to Giovanni Bosco on the pope's behalf requesting that the Salesians of Don Bosco aggregate the order.
This process was validated on 1 July 1994 and received the approval of a medical board on 21 February 2002.
Pius IX noted that Monti opposed this and so decided the order would not be aggregated at all.
He worked alongside the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin for a brief period of time while in Rome.
The group was released when it became obvious that the latter was a religious group and not a political one; the Cardinal Archbishop of Milan Bartolomeo Carlo Romilli also intervened to secure their release.
Monti died on 1 October 1900 almost blind.
Luigi Maria Monti (24 July 1825 – 1 October 1900) was an Italian Roman Catholic professed religious and the founder of the Sons of the Immaculate Conception.
Monti served as a nurse for most of his life and aided the ill in the Santo Spirito hospital in Rome while he was there and also worked to tend to ill people during the Brescia cholera epidemic in 1855.
Monti formed a small group of craftsman and farmers at the store he managed devoted to the Sacred Heart.
The theologians approved his spiritual writings on 8 February 1963 while the Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated the process on 16 June 1989 and then received the Positio dossier in 1993.
The process for a miracle spanned from 1964 until 1978 and the miracle in question involved the cure of Giovanni Luigi Iecle - who suffered from an intestinal condition - on 26 December 1961 in Bosa in Nuoro.
He and the other members of his group were charged with meeting to conspire against the Austrian forces who were in the area and in 1851 were jailed in Milan for ten weeks.
Pope Pius IX - on 4 March 1877 - blessed Monti's work and appointed him as its Superior General.
He aided the ill during the cholera epidemic in Brescia in 1855 and - with the aid of Dossi - began to set the foundations for a religious order he wished to establish to aid the sick and founded this on 8 September 1857.
Monti and his fellow nurse Cipriano Pezzini moved to Rome in 1858 where the two commenced work at the hospital of Santo Spirito.
Theologians approved it as well on 18 October 2002 as did the C.C.S. on 21 January 2003.
"He was referred to as ""Father"" despite not being an ordained priest."
The beatification cause opened under Pope Pius XII in 1941 and he became titled as a Servant of God - the first stage in the process for sainthood.
Monti became certified as a nurse with a diploma at the La Sapienza college.
"Two days later, he was suspended from the party."
"He said: ""I shone a light on the cash for ash scandal and as a result my party suspended me."
"Bell was originally elected for the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) but dissatisfied with the leadership of David Trimble, quit the party in March 2000."

"== Early life ==
Bell was the youngest of three children of Fergus Bell, a minister in the Free Methodist Church, and his wife Nora, a secretary."
He was suspended from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).
By the time of the 2001 local elections he had joined the DUP.
The fallout from the RHI scandal led to the opposition parties in the Northern Ireland Assembly to table an exclusion motion to remove Arlene Foster from her position as First Minister.
"On accepting the invitation to replace Robinson as an MLA he resigned his position as a member of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, as the Northern Ireland Act 1998 stipulated that membership of the Commission was incompatible with Assembly membership."
"In the period when Bell was supposed to have postponed the scheme, it transpired that there was a spike in applications and the bill for the scheme had increased massively."
"In January 2017, Martin McGuinness resigned as deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland in protest at the scheme, prompting the fall of the Executive Office of Northern Ireland."
"His wife, Lisa Bell, is a nurse."
"In May 2015, Bell was appointed Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in a re-shuffle of offices held by DUP MLAs which saw Arlene Foster, the previous DETI minister, move to Finance and Personnel."
"Following the Northern Ireland Assembly election on 5 May 2016, when Bell was elected as MLA for Strangford, DETI was renamed the Department for the Economy."
"== Political career ==
He sat on Craigavon Borough Council from 1997 until 2005, where he served as both deputy mayor and mayor."
"The scheme was devised under Arlene Foster, Bell's predecessor, who later went on to become First Minister."
"When he was appointed as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA), he was a councillor for the DUP in Ards."
He worked until 2010 in child care social work.
Bell came under fire as it was claimed that he postponed the closure of the scheme.
"On 16 December 2016, Bell gave an emotional interview with Stephen Nolan for BBC Northern Ireland about his and Foster's involvement with the scandal-hit Renewable Heat Incentive scandal."
== References ==
"Everywhere I have gone not a single person has told me I was wrong, in fact people have told me I was not wrong."
The motion failed on a cross-community vote.
"== Controversy ==
In May 2012, Bell attacked golf clubs in Northern Ireland for being a haven for sectarian attitudes, although he later apologised."
He alleged that Foster had ordered the postponement of the closure of the scheme and that her department tried to cover up her involvement in the scheme.
"In February 2017, Bell announced that he would contest the March 2017 Assembly Election as an Independent."
"By then, the political decline of the First Portuguese Republic was accentuating and, in May 1926, a military coup initiated a dictatorial regime."

"They returned to Portugal in February 1919, following Pais's assassination."
Elzira Dantas Gonçalves Pereira Machado  (15 December 1865 – 22 April 1942) was a Portuguese feminist activist.
Elzira Dantas accompanied her husband into exhile in France.
"Elzira Dantas Machado again accompanied her husband into exhile, in France and Spain."
"In 1915, her husband was elected President of the Republic."
"In the years that followed, the couple would have a total of nineteen children."

"During the Second World War and the Fall of France, in 1940, Salazar's government allows the Machados to return to Portugal."
"Bernardina died soon after, and Miguel Dantas Gonçalves Pereira and his daughter returned to Portugal."
"That year, on 12 June, President Canto e Castro made Elzira Dantas Machado a Grand Cross of the Order of Christ, on the same day the Portuguese Women's Crusade was made a Grand Cross of the Order of the Tower and of the Sword, of Valour, Loyalty and Merit."

"This performance attracted interest from the press, and his times in the 200 m and 400 m led to him being touted as a possible successor to Johnson."
He ran 9.72s with a tail wind of 1.7 m/s (6.1 km/h; 3.8 mph).
"With Yohan Blake injured, Bolt won the Jamaican 100 m title ahead of Kemar Bailey-Cole and skipped the 200 m, which was won by Warren Weir."
"He popularised the ""lightning bolt"" pose, also known as ""to di world"" or ""bolting"", which he used both before races and in celebration."
"Bolt denied the loss was due to a hamstring issue he had early that year and Gatlin responded: ""I don't know how many people have beaten Bolt but it's an honour""."
"He broke his own record by 0.11 seconds, finishing with a time of 19.19 seconds."
"In the World Championships 200 m, Bolt cruised through to the final which he won in a time of 19.40."
"Retired Jamaican sprinter Don Quarrie praised Bolt, saying he was confident that Johnson's record could be beaten."
"In what was intended to be his final race, Bolt pulled up in agony with 50 metres to go and collapsed to the track after what was later confirmed to be another hamstring injury."
Bolt turned his main focus to the 200 m and equalled Roy Martin's world junior record of 20.13 s at the Pan-American Junior Championships.
"Despite this run of form, he suffered only the second loss of his career in a 100 m final at the DN Galan."
"In the absence of a disciplined lifestyle, he became ever-more reliant on his natural ability to beat his competitors on the track."
"=== Financial crisis ===
Usain Bolt had fallen victim to a fraud scheme, resulting in the disappearance of more than $12 million from his retirement savings account, according to a letter from his attorneys obtained by the Associated Press."
"The Jamaican surprised even himself with the time, but coach Glen Mills remained confident that there was more to come."
"He has a brother, Sadiki, and a sister, Sherine."
"His achievements as a sprinter have earned him the media nickname ""Lightning Bolt"", and his awards include the IAAF World Athlete of the Year, Track & Field Athlete of the Year, BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year (three times), and Laureus World Sportsman of the Year (four times)."
"He is Catholic and known for making the sign of the cross before racing competitively, and he wears a Miraculous Medal during his races."
His habit of fist bumping the volunteers for good luck has been noted in the media.
Michael Johnson observed the race and said that he was shocked at how quickly Bolt had improved over the 100 m distance.

"""Bolt is also a fan of Premier League football team Manchester United."
"The school had a history of success in athletics with past students, including sprinter Michael Green."
Bolt's record-setting runs caused commentators not only to praise his achievements but to speculate about his potential to become one of the most successful sprinters in history.
"Bolt admitted that he was not running at full strength because he was suffering from a cold, but he concentrated on winning the race and finishing the season in good health."
"The following day, at the final, he won Jamaica's fourth gold of the Games, setting a new world and Olympic record of 19.30 s. Johnson's record fell despite the fact that Bolt was impeded by a 0.9 m/s (3.2 km/h; 2.0 mph) headwind."
"When Bolt was a boy, he attended Sherwood Content Seventh-day Adventist Church in Trelawny, Jamaica, with his mother."
"Bolt had aspired to run under twenty seconds to claim a season's best but, despite the fact that bad weather had impaired his run, he was happy to end the meeting with just the victory."
The competition featured variations on traditional track and field events.
"Hopefully, everything will fall into place""."
"The first record, 37.10 seconds, was set in winning gold at the 2008 Summer Olympics, although the result was voided in 2017 when the team was disqualified."
"Also at the 2017 World Athletics Championships, Bolt participated as the anchor runner for Jamaica's 4×100-metre relay team in both the heats and the final."
He committed himself to three further editions.
This proved to be the highest profile disqualification for a false start since the IAAF changed the rules that previously allowed one false start per race.
"An eight-time Olympic gold medallist, Bolt is the only sprinter to win Olympic 100 m and 200 m titles at three consecutive Olympics (2008, 2012, and 2016)."
"Bolt also holds the 200 metres world teenage best results for the age categories 15 (20.58 s), 16 (20.13 s, former world youth record), 17 (19.93 s) and 18 (19.93 s, world junior record)."
"He set a new championship record in the 200 m with a time of 20.40 s, despite a 1.1 m/s (4.0 km/h; 2.5 mph) head wind."
"Two days later, Bolt ran as the third leg in the Jamaican 4 × 100 metres relay team, increasing his gold medal total to three."
"After his recovery, Bolt was given new training exercises to improve flexibility, and the plans to move him up to the 400 m event were put on hold."
"The Jamaican team, featuring four of the top five from the 100 m final were comfortable winners with Bolt reaching the finish line on his anchor leg three tenths of a second ahead of the American team anchored by Gatlin."
"In September 2010, Bolt travelled to Australia where his sponsor Gatorade was holding an event called the ""Gatorade Bolt"" to find Australia's fastest footballer."
"He won the 200 m race by the largest margin in World Championships history, even though the race had three other athletes running under 19.90 seconds, the greatest number ever in the event."
Bolt! quickly became the No. 1 app in Jamaica and climbed the UK iTunes charts to reach No. 2 on the list of Top Free Apps.
"At Bolt's insistence, advertisements featuring him are filmed in Jamaica, by a Jamaican production crew, in an attempt to boost local enterprise and gain exposure for the country."
"He passed the finishing post with a time of 20.10 s, gaining a bronze medal in the process."
He performed at the inaugural meet in February 2017 and led his team (Bolt All-Stars) to victory.
"There was also a fourth straight win in the 4 × 100 metres relay with the Jamaica team (Nesta Carter, Asafa Powell, Nickel Ashmeade, Usain Bolt)."
"He built on this achievement at the 2007 World Championships in Osaka, Japan, winning a silver medal."
"Unlike in the 100 m final, Bolt sprinted hard all the way to the finishing line in the 200 m race, even dipping his chest to improve his time."
"Michael Johnson, the 200 m and 400 m record holder, personally backed the sprinter, saying that he did not believe that a lack of experience would work against him."
"The 200 m also yielded a silver, as Bolt finished in 21.81 s.He made his first appearance on the world stage at the 2001 IAAF World Youth Championships in Debrecen, Hungary."
It was the first time Bolt had been beaten at a major championship since the 4×100 m relay of the 2007 World Athletics Championships.
"Upon his return from injury, Bolt appeared a reduced figure at the start of the 2015 season."
This meant he had qualified for both events at the 2009 World Championships.
"After the championships, Bolt took 100 m wins on the 2013 IAAF Diamond League circuit in Zürich and Brussels."
Melbourne Stars chief executive Clint Cooper said there were free spots on his team should he be available.
"The event was held at the Sydney International Athletic Centre and featured football players from rugby league, rugby union, Australian rules football, and association football."
"=== 2008 Summer Olympics ===
Bolt doubled-up with the 100 metres and 200 metres events at the Beijing Summer Olympics."
"As part of his sponsorship deal with Puma, the manufacturer sends sporting equipment to his alma mater, William Knibb Memorial High School, every year."
He ran only two 100 m and three 200 m before the major championship.
"In 2017, the Jamaican team was stripped of the 2008 Olympics 4×100 metre title due to Nesta Carter's disqualification for doping offences."
"The previous six years had seen the BALCO scandal, Tim Montgomery and Justin Gatlin stripped of their 100 m world records, and Marion Jones returning three Olympic gold medals."
"As a member of the Jamaican sprint relay team, he also took two silver medals and set national junior records in the 4×100 metres and 4×400 metres relay, running times of 39.15 s and 3:04.06 minutes respectively."
"He yearned to run in the 100 metres but Mills was skeptical, believing that Bolt was better suited for middle distances."
The campaign was directed by Seth Gordon and features the Virgin founder Branson to promote its broadband service.
"He won the 200 m in a time of 20.61 s, which was 0.03 s slower than his personal best of 20.58 s, which he set in the 1st round."
Bolt pointed out that an important factor in his performance at the World Championships was his improved start to the races: his reaction times in the 100 m (0.146) and 200 m (0.133) were significantly faster than those he had produced in his world record runs at the Beijing Olympics.
"Jamaican government minister Edmund Bartlett also defended Bolt's actions, stating, ""We have to see it in the glory of their moment and give it to them."
"The company has begun operations in a number of U.S. cities, and plans to expand throughout Europe and Asia."
"Bolt had focused his athletics aims, stating that 2006 was a year to gain experience."
"Yes, that would be epic."
"However, once his reaction time of 0.148 s is subtracted, his time is 9.44 s, making his average speed 38.18 km/h (23.72 mph)."
He also met with French president Emmanuel Macron while at the conference.
"The disqualification caused some to question the new rule, with former world champion Kim Collins saying it was ""a sad night for athletics""."

Bolt was born on 21 August 1986 to parents Wellesley and Jennifer Bolt in Sherwood Content, a small town in Jamaica."

"Bolt's autobiography, My Story: 9.58: Being the World's Fastest Man, was released in 2010."
"Bolt then focused on attaining a gold medal in the 200 m event, aiming to emulate Carl Lewis' double win in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics."

"Biomechanics researchers have studied, with no firm conclusions, whether this asymmetry has helped or hurt Bolt in his sprinting career."
"Two 100 m runs of 9.87 in July in London showed better form, but in comparison, Justin Gatlin was easily the top ranked sprinter – the American had times of 9.74 and 19.57 seconds, and had already run under 9.8 seconds on four occasions that season."

Bolt ran the anchor leg for the finals of the 4 × 100 m relay and secured his third consecutive and last Olympic gold medal in the event.
"With that win, Bolt obtained the ""triple-triple"", three sprinting gold medals in three consecutive Olympics, and finished his Olympic career with a 100% win record in finals."
"He was detained by the police for his practical joke, and there was an outcry from the local community, which blamed coach McNeil for the incident."
"=== Documentary film ===
A documentary film based on the athletic life of Bolt to win three Olympic gold medals, titled I Am Bolt, was released on 28 November 2016 in United Kingdom."
"In November 2019, he followed up with another compilation called Immortal Riddim that included tracks from Vybz Kartel, Masicka, Munga Honorable and Christopher Martin."
"After his return from injury a month later, Bolt asserted himself with a 100 m win at the Athletissima meeting in Lausanne (9.82 seconds) and a victory over Asafa Powell at Meeting Areva in Paris (9.84 seconds)."
In January 2017 the Jamaican relay teammates were stripped of their gold medals when a blood sample taken from Carter after the race was retested and found positive for a banned substance.
Bolt recorded 19.91 s with a headwind of 0.8 m/s (2.9 km/h; 1.8 mph).
"Bolt also holds the second fastest time of 9.63 seconds, the current Olympic record, and set two previous world records in the event."
"Pablo McNeil, a former Olympic sprint athlete, and Dwayne Jarrett coached Bolt, encouraging him to focus his energy on improving his athletic abilities."
A similar outcome followed in the 200 m World finals.
"The 400 m time remains No. 6 on the all-time youth list, surpassed only once since, by future Olympic champion Kirani James."
"=== Average and top speeds ===
From his record time of 9.58 s for the 100 m sprint, Usain Bolt's average ground speed equates to 37.58 km/h (23.35 mph)."
"Bolt's runs were a significant improvement upon the previous records, beating the 200 m best by more than half a second and the 400 m record by almost a second."
"On the final day of the 2012 Olympic athletics, Bolt participated in Jamaica's gold medal-winning 4×100 metres relay team along with Nesta Carter, Michael Frater and Blake."
"Bolt had previously said that the book ""...should be exciting, it's my life, and I'm a cool and exciting guy."""
"However, it turned out to be a revelatory experience for Bolt, as he vowed never again to let himself be affected by pre-race nerves."
"Howard Hamilton, who was given the task of Public Defender by the government, urged the JAAA to nurture him and prevent burnout, calling Bolt ""the most phenomenal sprinter ever produced by this island""."
"Bolt's coach reported that, based upon the speed of Bolt's opening 60 m, he could have finished with a time of 9.52 s. After scientific analysis of Bolt's run by the Institute of Theoretical Astrophysics at the University of Oslo, Hans Eriksen and his colleagues also predicted a sub 9.60 s time."
IOC president Jacques Rogge also condemned the Jamaican's actions as disrespectful.
Blake was the silver medallist with a time of 9.75 seconds.
"In June 2008, Bolt responded to claims that he was a lazy athlete, saying that the comments were unjustified, and he trained hard to achieve his potential."
"He was served an unexpected defeat by Justin Gatlin, with the American winning 9.94 to Bolt's 9.95."
"Bolt had himself tested on 22 August, the day after celebrating his 34th birthday with a party where guests did not wear face masks."
"At the Super Grand Prix final in Lausanne, Bolt ran his second-fastest 200 m with a time of 19.63 s, equalling Xavier Carter's track record."
Bolt was less challenged in the 200 m final.
"Bolt completed a total of 53 wind-legal sub-10-second performances in the 100 m during his career, with his first coming on 3 May 2008 and his last on 5 August 2017 at the World Championships."
"However, he was hampered by a leg injury and was eliminated in the first round of the 200 metres with a disappointing time of 21.05 s. American colleges offered Bolt track scholarships to train in the United States while continuing to represent Jamaica on the international stage, but the teenager from Trelawny refused them all, stating that he was content to stay in his homeland of Jamaica."
Bolt won his first annual high school championships medal in 2001; he took the silver medal in the 200 metres with a time of 22.04 seconds.
"Bolt followed up his 100 m win with a gold medal in the 200 m, which also makes him the first athlete to win the 200 m three times at the Olympic Games."
Mills recognised Bolt's potential and aimed to cease what he considered an unprofessional approach to the sport.
"He had his best offensive season in 1993, hitting for a .258 batting average with thirteen home runs and 63 runs batted in."
"David Valle (; born October 30, 1960) is an American former professional baseball player."

"Through undoubtedly a poet of the romantic era, he was increasingly popular among the positivists and the authors of the Young Poland period in the late 1800s and early 1900s."
"Słowacki was not a very popular figure in Paris, nor among his contemporaries."
"He wrote many dramas, which can be seen as his favorite genre, yet he was a playwright who never saw any of his work performed on stage (only Mazepa was staged during his lifetime, and not in his presence)."

He addressed the National Committee (Komitet Narodowy) in Poznań on 27 April.
"Second, he notes that Słowacki was not only inspired by works of others, from poets and writers to scholars and philosophers, but that his texts were often a masterful, ironic-grotesque polemic with other creators."

This work introduced his philosophical system that would have a visible influence on his works in his last decade.
Słowacki is also considered the father of modern Polish drama.
"He settled briefly in Paris, France, and later in Geneva, Switzerland."
"He also became respected abroad; a 1902 English language book edited by Charles Dudley Warner noted that ""the splendid exuberance of his thought and fancy ranks him among the great poets of the nineteenth century""."

"In Anhelli, Słowacki's describes the tragic fate of Polish exiles in Siberia, painting a gloomy vision of Poland's destiny; the same topic was taken by Mickiewicz in the Books of the Polish Nation and of the Polish Pilgrimage as a call for Poles to spread hope and spirituality across Europe."
"In 1842 he joined the religious-philosophical group, Koło Sprawy Bożej (Circle of God's Cause), led by Andrzej Towiański."

"He was its singer, its spiritual leader in the full meaning of the term""."
"In the 1840s he developed his own philosophy, or mystical system, with works such as Król-Duch and Genesis z Ducha being an exposition of his philosophical ideas (""genesic philosophy"") according to which the material world is an expression of an ever-improving spirit capable of progression (transmigration) into constantly newer forms."

"In 1836, Słowacki left Switzerland and embarked on a journey that started in Italy."
"That year, the November Uprising began, and Słowacki published several poems with patriotic and religious overtones."
"During the November 1830 Uprising, he was a courier for the Polish revolutionary government."
"Starting as a story of a historical figure, it developed into a discussion of the poet's own life and opinions."

His letters to his mother are among the finest letters in all Polish literature.
One of his friends was the pianist and composer Frédéric Chopin.
"Ławski, enumerating the main characteristics of Słowacki's writings, notes first that he was a ""creationist"", in the sense of creating new meanings and words (many of his characters bear names he invented himself, such as Kordian)."
He never married.
"It took almost two decades and the backing of Józef Piłsudski, for whom Słowacki was a favorite poet, to obtain the Church's agreement to interring Słowacki at Wawel Cathedral."
"Słowacki's interment at Waweł Cathedral was controversial, as many of his works were considered heretical by Polish Catholic-Church officials."

From 1825 to 1828 he studied law at Vilnius Imperial University.
"Although the majority of his works were in Polish, he tried his hand at several works in French language (Le roi de Landawa, Beatrix Cenci)."

"The third volume of his poems, published in 1833 and contains works from the period of the Uprising, was far more nationalist in tone and won more recognition in his homeland."
"In 2009 the Polish Sejm (parliament) declared that year, the two-hundredth anniversary of Słowacki's birth, to be the Year of Juliusz Słowacki."
"It was a journey Słowacki described in his epic poem Podróż do Ziemi Świętej z Neapolu (""Travel to the Holy Land from Naples""); his other works of that period inclucded the poem Ojciec zadżumionych (The Father of the Plague-stricken), Grób Agamemnona (Agamemnon's Grave), Rozmowa z piramidami (A talk with the pyramids), Anhelli and Listy poetyckie z Egiptu (Poetic Letters from Egypt)."
"However, Słowacki's poems, written in the 1820s, were unpopular among his Polish compatriots, as they failed to capture the sentiment of a people living under foreign occupation."
"His works, written in Polish, dense with Slavic myths, philosophy and symbols, were difficult to translate to other languages."
"While a small circle of his friends talked about his wit, perseverance and inspiration, in popular memory he was a ""sickly man of weak character"", egocentric, bitter due to his failed rivalry with Mickiewicz."
"But by 9 May, the revolt was crushed."
"Other scholars offer slightly different periodizations; for example dividing his works into a classical period, a Swiss period, a Parisian period and a genesis period."

He became a major literary figure for the new generation of Polish writers.
"His father, Euzebiusz Słowacki, a Polish nobleman of the Leliwa coat of arms, taught rhetoric, poetry, Polish language, and the history of literature at the Krzemieniec Lyceum in Kremenets; from 1811 he held the chair (katedra) of rhetoric and poetry at Vilnius Imperial University."
Krasiński is considered the first serious literary critic of Słowacki's work.

"It was there in 1822 that the 13-year-old met Adam Mickiewicz, the first of the Three Bards of Polish literature."
On 8 March 1831 he was sent on a courier mission to Dresden (some sources say this was not an official mission but a private journey).
"In 1927, some eight years after Poland had regained independence, the Polish government arranged for Słowacki's remains to be transferred from Paris to Wawel Cathedral, in Kraków."
"On his way there, he passed through Wrocław, where in mid-June he was reunited with his mother, whom he had not seen for almost twenty years."
The rivalry between the two Bards for primacy would continue till the ends of lives.
"Renate Puvogel, in her book Carl Larsson (Cologne: Taschen; 1994), gives detailed information about Larsson's life: ""His mother was thrown out of the house, together with Carl and his brother Johan; after enduring a series of temporary dwellings, the family moved into Grev Magnigränd No. 7 (later No. 5) in what was then Ladugårdsplan, present-day Östermalm""."

Carl Olof Larsson (Swedish pronunciation: [ˈkɑːɭ ˈlɑ̌ːʂɔn] (listen); 28 May 1853 – 22 January 1919) was a Swedish painter representative of the Arts and Crafts movement.
"Carl Larsson considered his monumental works, such as his frescos in schools, museums and other public buildings, to be his most important works."
"However, the print runs of these rather expensive albums did not come close to that produced in 1909 by the German publisher Karl Robert Langewiesche (1874–1931)."
"Larsson's father worked as a casual laborer, sailed as a stoker on a ship headed for Scandinavia, and lost the lease to a nearby mill, only to work there later as a mere grain carrier."
"As a rule, each room was home to three families; ""penury, filth and vice thrived there, leisurely seethed and smouldered, eaten-away and rotten bodies and souls."

"Langewiesche's choice of watercolours, drawings and text by Carl Larsson, titled Das Haus in der Sonne (Königstein, Verlag Karl Robert Langewiesche. 1909), immediately became one of the German publishing industry's best-sellers of the year—40,000 copies sold in three months, and more than 40 print runs have been produced up to 2001."
"While working on Midvinterblot (1915), a large decoration for the vestibule of the Nationalmuseum, Larsson experienced the onset of an eye problem and a worsening of his frequent headaches."
He is principally known for his watercolors of idyllic family life.
"In 1987 the museum was even offered the monumental painting for free, provided it would adorn the empty wall for which it had been intended, but the museum declined the offer, so the painting was sold to the Japanese collector Hiroshi Ishizuka."
"During his first years there, Larsson felt socially inferior, confused, and shy."
"After spending two summers in Barbizon, the refuge of the plein-air painters, he settled down with his Swedish painter colleagues in 1882, in Grez-sur-Loing at a Scandinavian artists' colony outside Paris."
"Through his paintings and books, Little Hyttnäs has become one of the most famous artist's homes in the world, transmitting the artistic taste of its creators and making it a major line in Swedish interior design."

"In 1859, Rose Ann Miller started the girls’ boarding school at Aburi, predecessor to the present-day Aburi Girls’ Secondary School, fulfilling both her teaching and administrative duties until 1874."
"She had two younger siblings, brother Robert Miller (born 29 May 1839) and sister, Catherine Miller (born 1 July 1842) both on Pepper Plantage."
"However, Rose Ann's father, Joseph viewed the Euro-African mulatto men as philanderers who were unfit for long-term stable marriage."
"No positive outcome came from this last option leading Rose Ann Miller to write a complaint to the then presiding Basel missionary of the Akropong station, Johann Georg Widmann, using parables alluding to funerals and motifs of social rank to lament her position."
They interceded on Miller's behalf at the Basel headquarters for the Home Committee to reduce her workload at the same salary.
"== Early life and education ==
Rose Ann Miller was born on 16 March 1836 on Pepper Plantage in Fairfield, Jamaica, to Joseph Miller (born 1800), a farm worker and his wife, Mary Miller (born 1811), both of whom were freed slaves."
"In another entrepreneurial move, she donated sixty coffee seedlings to the Aburi girls’ boarding school farm."
"Moreover, Joseph Miller was seen as a “difficult character."
Joseph Miller wrote a complaint letter to the Home Committee in Basel after this episode.
"Her mother, Mary Miller intervened and contacted, Henry Wharton, a Wesleyan missionary in Jamestown, British Accra who employed her at the Methodist School there after conferring with the Basel missionaries."
"According to the Millers, the missionaries had favourable attributes like “monogamous traditions, strict control… stable income and privileged position on the mission field.”"
"== Personal life ==
Rose Ann Miller remained unmarried throughout her life due to drama and disagreements by the relevant parties involved in the marriage-making decision: her father, Joseph Miller, the European Basel missionaries, potential suitors and herself."
"The final group of potential future spouses was the European Basel missionaries, including Johann Gottlieb Christaller."
"In 1857, she was appointed the head of the infant girls’ school at Akropong."
"In 1848, the United Akropong School was founded by Alexander Worthy Clerk, one of the Jamaican missionaries."
The Cape Coast offer was on par with a Wesleyan mission and a government-employed teacher's salary of £25 and £24 respectively in 1875 while a government headmistress in the same city made £72.
"The inaugural class had thirty-seven girls, twenty-five boys and seven children of the West Indians."
"Though she did not seek permission from the Aburi mission station head, the Basel missionary, Johann Dieterle, she was left unpunished as her initiative showed a sense of purpose–a summation of Jon Miller's concept of “strategic deviant.”"
The emerging Euro-African coastal elite was also a source of finding a future husband.
"In contrast, her annual salary with the Basel mission was only £16 in 1874."
"In 1873, the Mohr couple permanently returned to Europe."
"Anytime, Mohr travelled for midwifery work, it was Miller who ran the school as the headmistress."
"== Death and legacy ==
Rose Ann Miller died of natural causes in Accra in 1930 at the age of ninety-four."
"Other West Indian children who were taught at the school included Andrew Hall, Robert Miller, Catherine Miller, Elizabeth Mullings, Ann Rochester and John Rochester."
The Basel Mission hierarchy did not permit African teachers to superintend European staff.
"This meant that between 1861 and 1873, Rose Ann Miller was officially subordinate to the midwife, Julie Mohr, spouse of Basel missionary, Joseph Mohr."
"=== Entrepreneurial initiatives ===
Miller purchased a coffee farm in the early 1860s with the aim of raising funds locally using financial proceeds from farm produce to supplement her meagre teacher's salary."
"In spring 1843, a seven-year old Rose Ann Miller joined her parents, siblings and twenty other Moravian Christian compatriots to sail to the Gold Coast under the aegis of the Basel Evangelical Missionary Society."
"It is said that “a bond of unity bound all the West Indians together” and in the Moravian tradition, they referred to one other as ‘brother’ and ‘sister’."
Income from cash-crop farming was sometimes used to support her parents when they ran into financial difficulties.
"In 1858, J. G. Christaller and the Home Committee discouraged another potential Basel missionary suitor, Johann Ludwig Haas from marrying Miller as they considered it a “not really desirable development”."
"As an educator and a school principal, she mentored several young women in the hinterlands."
"The society's team of recruiters included Johann Georg Widmann, George Peter Thompson and Andreas Riis, all ordained missionaries."
Rose Ann Miller (16 March 1836 – 1930) was a Jamaican-born educator pioneer who worked extensively on the Gold Coast in both Basel Mission and government-run schools.
"”Later, when Rose Ann Miller was eighteen years old, an arranged marriage in 1854 to Antiguan, Jonas Horsford was called off after the missionary couple, Johann and Rosina Widmann intervened in the matter."
"Growing up in Akropong, Miller mastered the Akuapem-Twi language and became accustomed to local customs."
"Shortly after their arrival in Christiansborg in April 1843, Rose Ann Miller and the rest of the West Indians relocated to Akropong and lived on Hanover Street, an area of town with a mango tree-lined street and little stone houses where all the other Caribbean families lived."
The Millers were afraid their daughter will become a domestic slave under the matrilineal system in Akan society.
"In 1864, she received a letter of commendation from the St. Petersburg Women’s Association, recognising her as an exemplar of economic independence who pursued filial piety for her ageing parents."
She also made extra income through needle-work by being a part-time seamstress or dressmaker.
A series of related events which Widmann reported to the Home Committee as provocative led to the suspension of Rose Ann Miller from her teaching post in 1856.
"He also worked with his fellow Akan linguists, David Asante, Theophilus Opoku and Paul Staudt Keteku."
"However, her farm made use of a domestic worker who was eventually given to her mother, Mary Miller in 1863."

"Another possible future spouse, Jonathan Palmer Bekoe was rejected by her parents because as a Christian convert, Bekoe came from a native Akan polygamous family that practised matrilineal inheritance with fewer rights granted to non-Akan wives."
"In 1870, Miller visited Cape Coast and was offered a teaching post of £73 per annum."
The home board rejected that idea saying a lighter teaching schedule would go with lower pay.
"Bekoe was in the pioneer class of the Basel Mission Seminary, Akropong and trained as a teacher-catechist, linguist and translator working with German missionary and philologist, Johann Gottlieb Christaller to translate the Bible into the Twi language."
"Nonetheless, Julie Mohr and Rose Ann Miller “formed a collegial relationship.”"
"A prospective bridegroom, Alexander Worthy Clerk refused to marry her when her father, Joseph Miller approached him because Clerk did not want to be his son-in-law."

"During the early 1970s, Williamson was involved in working with the Committee of Twenty for devising the IMF's strategy to comprehensive systemic reforms."
"The term arose from a publication, “What Washington Means by Policy Reform” (1990) that described what countries should do according to the convictions of Washington-based institutions."
"He made 10 rules that were imposed by the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the US government on developing nations."
"In other words, the investor obtains a stake in a country's growth through this ""equity-like"" feature."
"Following graduation, Williamson served two years of compulsory military service in the Royal Air Force."
He was invited by the United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan to assess policy reform in Latin America.
"His policies had also been connected to the neoliberal policies of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, whom he disliked."
"He was in charge of overseeing relations with the European Economic Community, particularly France."
He connected these policy recommendations to his advocacy of target zones and limited exchange-rate fluctuations.
"Many of those who attended, including Allan Meltzer, Richard Feinberg, and Stanley Fischer, were receptive to the idea."
"He also published a textbook, The Exchange-Rate System; The Open Economy and the World Economy (1983)."
"At the 1987 Louvre Accord, the G-5 industrialized nations adopted a system of reference exchange rates that was influenced by proposals of C. Fred Bergsten and John Williamson for a target zone system."
"He argued that intermediate exchange-rate regimes maintain competitiveness in increasingly globalized economies, while also being politically favorable."
"In the 1990s, Williamson continued his policy-oriented contributions."
Critics of the Washington Consensus argue that it endorses complete free movements of capital.
"While serving at the Treasury, Williamson was offered chairs in economics from the University of Manchester, University of Nottingham, and the University of Warwick."
He graduated from Hereford High School for Boys and had originally planned to study civil engineering.
"Some politicians, notably the former finance minister of Brazil Luiz Carlos Bresser-Pereira, recognized that the term had been used outside of the original context."
"== Personal life ==
Williamson married Denise Rosemary Rausch (b. 1940), a scholar at the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística)."
"It argues that, instead of fixed interest rates, certain securities should bear an interest rate that positively correlated with the growth of a country."
"He was influenced by courses he took with well known economists, including Oskar Morgenstern, William Baumol, and Richard E. Quandt."
"""John Williamson, 83, Dies; Economist Defined the ‘Washington Consensus': A careful pragmatist, he regretted the way his term, aimed at developing countries, was misinterpreted by free-market ideologues and anti-globalization activists."""
"He argued that these targets should be based on estimates of the real exchange rate, which would accommodate secular trends in productivity growth, real shocks to the economy, and new information."
"The idea was also developed by other distinguished economists, including Nobel Prize Laureates Robert Shiller and Joseph Stiglitz."
"While at Warwick, Williamson took a leave of absence to serve as an adviser to the International Monetary Fund."
"The main mechanism of adjustment was monetary policy, supported by direct exchange-rate intervention."
"There was also a committee, chaired by Sir Douglas Allen, that formed British views on international monetary reform."
"== Career ==
Williamson's first academic posting was at the University of York, where he taught microeconomics."
"== Research ==
Williamson is the author or editor of over 40 books on international monetary and developing-world debt issues."
Williamson argued that these bonds would help countries obtain stability from capital flight.
It became more widely known after a conference at the Institute for International Economics.
"During that time, he was the project director for the United Nations High-Level Panel on Financing for Development in 2001."
Williamson et al. argued for prudential capital controls for developing countries through international coordination efforts.
"Beginning in 1985, Williamson worked with Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Richard Darman to develop a comprehensive system of optimal exchange rates (""target zones"")."
He developed new forecasts on how British export markets were predicted to expand following various policy recommendations.
"He then attended graduate school at Princeton University, graduating with a Ph.D. in Economics in 1963."
He was a critic of capital liberalization and the bipolar exchange rate.
"The project, headed by President of Mexico Ernesto Zedillo, involved assessing options for expanding the roles of the World Trade Organization and the International Labour Organization."
"After serving as visiting professor of economics at Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio de Janeiro, Williamson joined the-then Institute for International Economics as a Senior Fellow in 1981."
"The panel found that to secure economic growth and equity, developing countries needed to achieve balanced budgets, ensure macroeconomic discipline, and support human capital investments."
He served as a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics from 1981 until his retirement in 2012.
"During the 1980s, while working at the Institute for International Economics, Williamson began exploring theories on target zones."
"Shortly thereafter, however, the target zones were replaced due to the belief that free-floating exchange rates would have been preferred."
This Zedillo Report also recommended that the United Nations organize a series of climate-change conferences.
"More recently, economists have recognized that the term was misconstrued from its original meaning, notably with regard to the opening of the capital account."
Research has shown that Williamson was largely correct in his assessment of altering expectations through his proposal of post-Louvre target zones.
"The findings of the report, the Report of the High-level Panel on Financing for Development (2001) were discussed at a subsequent conference."
"However, his headmaster convinced him to do economics and he decided to attend the London School of Economics."
"In 1996, Williamson became Chief Economist for South Asia, World Bank."
There he became Honorary Professor and taught courses in international economics and macroeconomics.
"He worked with Fred Bergsten, then the institute's Director, on ways of helping Latin American countries stabilize their currencies through this process."
He also felt that advocacy for economic stabilization through his policies were not necessarily neoliberal.
"For much of his academic career, he worked on a theory of ""intermediate"" exchange rates as an intermediate between fixed exchange rates and floating exchange rates."
"In this capacity, he gained an international reputation for his contributions to the field."
"Rüdiger Dornbusch (MIT) summarized this proposal as a ""BBC"" (band, basket, and crawl)."
Williamson further coined the concept of “fundamental equilibrium exchange rate” (FEER) in Estimating Equilibrium Exchange Rates (1994) to describe how exchange-rate misalignments resulted in balance-of-payments crises.
"He is best known for defining the ""Washington Consensus"" in 1989."
Williamson claimed that the guidelines were meant to establish economic stability through stable institutions and cooperation.
He later included an updated set of policy proposals to the Washington Consensus in “What Should the World Bank Think about the Washington Consensus?” (2000).
He replaced Fred Hirsch as senior adviser.
"=== Exchange rates ===
Much of Williamson's early career focused on developing a theory of the crawling peg."
"In October 1968, Williamson was appointed an adviser to the H.M. Treasury."
"The system entailed gradual devaluations of the currency, changing expectations that the currency will devalue and interest rates would be sufficiently high to compensate bondholders."
"He was also on leave as chief economist for South Asia at the World Bank during 1996–99, adviser to the International Monetary Fund from 1972 to 1974, and an economic consultant to the UK Treasury from 1968 to 1970."
These refer to securities where the issuer (a government) promises to pay the investor returns based on the changes to that country's GDP.
"== Early life and education ==
John Harold Williamson was born in Hereford in 1937."
"John Harold Williamson (June 7, 1937 – April 11, 2021) was a British-born economist who coined the term Washington Consensus."
His theories on the crawling peg were well received among economists.
"Since the term entered public discourse, it has been misinterpreted and distorted from its original meaning."
He ultimately accepted the latter because he was attracted to the theories and research at newer universities.
"Joseph Stiglitz, former Chief Economist of the World Bank and Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, did not object to the Washington Consensus per se, but to the neoliberal policies that policymakers have adopted."
"He noted, at the time, that the policies were appropriate for some Latin American countries, but not for many others."
He conducted operations research at the Department of the Scientific Adviser to the Air Ministry in Whitehall.
The IMF began using FEERs as the basis of its exchange-rate policies.
"He has authored/co-authored 56 journal articles, and has been cited around 2,000 times according to Google Scholar."
"As Narcís Serra, Shari Spiegel, and Joseph E. Stiglitz, noted ""the Washington Consensus has come to be associated with ‘market fundamentalism,’ the view that markets solve most, if not all, economic problems by themselves—views from which Williamson has carefully distanced himself."
"In 2018, he stated that climate change was the number one concern facing economics."
"Exchange rates were the main focus of the Treasury, as the IMF's Special Drawing Rights had recently been introduced."
"Following his retirement, Williamson wrote a book on growth-linked securities."
"Instead, Williamson argued that these were a series of recommendations—not requirements—for Latin American countries."
"At the time, there were four other professors on the economics department: Alan T. Peacock, Jack Wiseman, John Hutton, and Douglas Dosser."
The Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística) offered him a post to begin its graduate program in economics.
"His proposal contrasted with the existing adjustable peg, in which the rate is pegged in the short run."
Business executive Joshua Cooper Ramo coined the term Beijing Consensus to frame China's economic development as an alternative to the Washington Consensus.
"Sir Roy Harrod of Christ Church, Oxford University offered him a prestigious post, which Williamson declined."
"However, Williamson's 1989 conceptualization of the consensus only included foreign direct investment."
"There, he further developed research on international monetary cooperation."
"After two years, he returned to Warwick where he published The Failure of World Monetary Reform, 1971–74 (1977)."
"In 2012, Williamson retired from the PIIE."
"Williamson resided in Chevy Chase, Maryland."
"In turn, Williamson argued that the Beijing Consensus comprised five major points: 1. incremental reform, 2. innovation, 3. export-led growth, 4. state capitalism, and 5. authoritarianism."
"In September 2019, he was named in Easterns' squad for the 2019–20 CSA Provincial T20 Cup."

"While still an infant, he moved with his family to Erivan, where he soon started attending a Russian-Muslim primary school and later the Erivan gymnasium (secondary school in the Russian Imperial education system)."
In 1935 he was appointed head of the Azerbaijan Medical University.
"Aziz Mammad Karim oghlu Aliyev (Azerbaijani: Əziz Məmməd Kərim oğlu Əliyev; 20 December 1896 – 27 July 1962) was an Azerbaijani, Dagestani, and Soviet politician, scientist, and member of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR."
In 1950 Aliyev was appointed Deputy Chairman of the Azerbaijan SSR Supreme Soviet.
"During these years he published a number of articles and textbooks, and was editor of the Azerbaijani Medical Journal."
In 1952 he was further demoted to physician at a hospital in a Baku suburb.
In 1934 he became head of the Baku Department of Health Care.
In 1939–1941 he served as Azerbaijan Minister of Health Care.
"Concerned by rumours of being replaced by Aliyev, Baghirov managed to have him fired from the executive power of Dagestan and sent to Moscow to work as an inspector in the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union."
His other daughter Gulara Aliyeva became a composer and concertmaster.
"After graduating with honours, Aliyev was sponsored by philanthropist Zeynalabdin Taghiyev to enter the Russian Medical Military Academy in Saint Petersburg in 1917."
In 1951 he was fired from the government and became director of the Institute of Orthopædy.
In 1923 he came to Baku to work in the administrative department of the Azerbaijan Council of Ministers and finish his undergraduate degree in medical studies.
"He openly supported the heritage of Imam Shamil, the 19th century Muslim leader of an anti-Russian resistance, that is well-celebrated by Dagestanis but had been frowned upon and dismissed by the Kremlin at the time due to its religious and nationalist nature."
"Due to his high academic standing, he was exempt from paying for education, fortunately for his family who were in financial need."
"During the six years that he served in this position, Aliyev managed to put an end to hostility expressed by the locals towards the central government."
"Three of their children: Tamerlan, Zarifa and Jamil, pursued careers in medicine."
"== Early life ==
Aziz Aliyev was born into an Azerbaijani working-class family in Hamamli (present-day Ashtarak), Armenia."
In November 1942 Aliyev held a meeting with aul leaders aiming to reconcile them with the Communist government.
"== Political career ==
In 1938 Aziz Aliyev was elected secretary of the Azerbaijan SSR Supreme Soviet."
"== Medical career ==
In 1928 Aziz Aliyev worked as head of the medical department of the Azerbaijan People's Commissariat (Ministry) of Health Care."
"The Dagestan branch of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, the Dagestan State Pedagogical University (founded as the Dagestani Women Teachers Institute), a number of theatres and professional medical schools of this autonomous republic were founded during Aliyev's term."
In 1929 he was promoted to Deputy Minister of Health Care and director of the Azerbaijan State Clinical Institute.
"In the early 1920s he worked in aid posts in Erivan, Nakhchivan and on the southern bank of the Aras River."
"In 1941, after the Soviet invasion of Iranian Azerbaijan and Iranian Kurdistan, Aliyev was deployed to Tabriz on a political mission."
"=== Dagestan ===
On 16 September 1942 Joseph Stalin appointed Aliyev Secretary of the Dagestan Regional Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the highest authority in the Dagestan ASSR."
"== Family ==
In 1920 Aziz Aliyev married Leyla Abbasova, an Erivan-native."
The official reason behind this repression was the accusation that Aliyev never reported his parents' social origin; aggravated by the fact that his sister lived in Iran.
"Because of the October Revolution and civil unrest in the South Caucasus marked by political instability and ethnic cleansings, Aliyev had to return to Armenia in 1918 and fled with his family first to Shahtakhti (a town in Nakhchivan) and then to northern Iran."
"At the peak of the Great Patriotic War, desertion driven by mutual distrust between the Soviet authorities and the peoples of the Caucasus, was a huge issue (in 1944 it would lead to the deportation of over 600,000 residents of the North Caucasus into Central Asia that did not affect Dagestanis)."
"From 1656 to 1658 he was a missioner to the Cayuga, and later to the Oneida."

René Menard: A Life Story Which Connects the Finger Lakes Region of New York with France, Québec, Georgian Bay and Wisconsin by Alexander McGinn Stewart
The Wisconsin Journey by Kurt Leichtle
""The Jesuit Relations and Allied Documents: Travels and Explorations of the Jesuit Missionaries in New France 1610-1791"" Chapter VIII describes Menard's final mission."
"In 1660, Ménard was sent west from Montreal with a trading party of Ottawa and the fur traders Radisson and Groseilliers, heading for what is now northern Wisconsin, aiming to establish a mission among the Ottawa."
"Leaving Trois-Rivières, Québec at the end of August, they paddled for six weeks up the St. Lawrence, up the Ottawa River, and across Georgian Bay."
"In the spring he heard that a band of Hurons in the interior was starving, and he set off to minister to them, though he himself had only a bag of sturgeon and some dried meat."
He sheltered in a hut he made of tree branches and at times he subsisted on fish begged from the Indians and boiled moss.
"Separated from the French traders and his assistant, he was forced to paddle continuously and carry heavy loads with meager rations."
"== Biography ==
René Ménard was born in Paris on 2 March 1605."
"At a rapids a day's journey from the Huron village, Ménard, now weak with hunger himself, became separated from his companion, and disappeared."

"Ménard also worked with the Iroquois, and was said to speak six Indian dialects."
"After the usual course of studies at La Flèche, Bourges, and Orleans, he set out from Dieppe in the beginning of May 1640."
From 1651 to 1656 he was the superior at Trois-Rivières.
The party didn't go easy on the frail Father.
"Despite the hardships and resistance from many Indians, he baptized and taught the Christian faith."
He joined the Jesuits there on 7 September 1624.
He and a fur trader nicknamed L'Esperance walked and canoed down into what is believed to be present-day Taylor County in north central Wisconsin.

Classes in Contemporary Capitalism.
"In many areas, he foresaw the current debate on the critical Marxian language of class, bourgeoisie, and hegemony finds little echo in contemporary political science, where its positivism requires researchers to focus on putative measurable and objective entities."
"In his later works, Poulantzas analysed the role of what he termed the ""new petty bourgeoisie"" in both consolidating the ruling classes hegemony and undermining the proletariat's ability to organise itself."
"By occupying a contradictory class position—that is to say, by identifying with its de facto oppressor—this fraction of the working class throws its lot in with the bourgeois whose fate it (wrongly) believes it shares."
"The fragmentation (some would argue the demise) of the class system is, for Poulantzas, a defining characteristic of late capitalism, and any politically useful analysis must tackle this new constellation of interests and power."

"While Clipse resumed work on the album, and eventually finished its recording, the duo became increasingly frustrated with Jive, as the label overlooked it in favor of the more pop-oriented acts on its roster, which caused numerous delays in the release of Hell Hath No Fury."
"The video, which was directed by No Malice, opens with multiple quotes from the Bible: first, from Ephesians 4:31, ""Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice;"" then, from 1 Peter 2:1, ""Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil speakings;"" and Romans 1:29, ""Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers;"" and Colossians 3:8, ""But now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth."

It depicted No Malice viewing himself in a casket in a funeral parlor and walking away.
"On June 19, 2012, No Malice released the first single from Hear Ye Him titled ""June"" featuring Eric David."
"The album debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-hop Album chart and No. 4 on the Billboard 200, fueled by the strength of the lead singles ""Grindin'"" and ""When the Last Time"", which peaked at No. 30 and No. 19 respectively, on the Billboard Hot 100."
"However, further work on the album ground to a halt in 2004, when Arista Records's urban artists were absorbed into its sister label Jive Records as part of a larger merger between Sony Music Entertainment and BMG."
"While the album received a great deal of critical acclaim, its sales were modest, at 78,000 in the first week."

"The Daily Beast said the issue could be the ""nail in the coffin"" for Bevin's campaign, while The Washington Post wrote, ""On its own, the cockfighting story isn't enough to sink Bevin's campaign."
"Senator Paul was in attendance and pledged to do ""anything humanly possible"" to elect Bevin; State Senate President Robert Stivers and State House Minority Leader Jeff Hoover, a Comer ally, both endorsed Bevin as well."
"This process, which is enforced through the Goebel Election Law, has only been used once, during the 1899 Kentucky gubernatorial election."
Federal taxpayer dollars appropriated to Planned Parenthood flow through the governor's administration.
"Conway's five-percentage-point margin held up a month later; just a week before the election, a Bluegrass poll showed 45 percent support for Conway, 40 percent for Bevin, and 6 percent for Curtis."
"We need to effectively come up with a program that works for folks."""
Bevin issued many controversial pardons during his tenure.
"During a debate featuring all four Republican candidates on Kentucky Sports Radio, Bevin said, ""I don't know if [Heiner's] behind the Comer story, but I'm telling you his people have been pushing this for a long time."
"At the time, Glenna was a divorced single mother of a 5-year-old daughter who was born during her first marriage to an abusive husband."
"In December 2015, Bevin announced that the state would not renew an advertising contract for kynect."
"Bevin deleted all posts from his Twitter feed prior to February 2015, including several critical of McConnell."
He also attempted to reverse Kentucky's Medicaid expansion and to reduce teacher pensions.
The Kentucky legislature overrode his veto on the bill and three others.
"The president of the Jefferson County Teachers Association responded that by Bevin's logic, schools should never have any breaks or vacations."
"That duly-executed marriage contract could then be filed and recorded at the county clerk's office just like a mortgage, a lien, a deed, etc."", Bevin's public statement said."
"In early October, the first poll released after Curtis entered the field showed Conway leading with 42 percent support among likely voters, compared to Bevin's 37 percent and Curtis' 7 percent."
"Bevin was referencing the Agricultural Act of 2014, commonly called the ""farm bill"", which contained a provision that criminalized spectators at cockfighting events."
"Bevin was widely criticized for pardoning hundreds of criminals in his last days in office, including several people convicted of serious violent crimes and a relative of a contributor to his campaign."
"Asked about his attendance, Bevin said he understood that the rally was a states' rights event: ""I was the first person to speak and then I left."""
"The crowded primary was also projected to damage the Republican nominee's chances in the general election, since Attorney General Jack Conway was the only major Democratic candidate, allowing him to conserve resources for the general election."
"On March 26, 2019, Bevin signed a bill that required public universities to protect free speech rights by banning them from disinviting speakers."
"Dentists said that they had to turn children away, including some with significant dental decay."
"Planned Parenthood countered that, before the license could be finalized, the abortion facility would have to be subjected to an unannounced inspection, requiring that abortions were already being performed there."
"== Personal life ==
While stationed at Fort Polk, Bevin went on a blind date with his future wife, Glenna."
The eleven-member Bevin family is the largest to inhabit the mansion since it was constructed in 1914.
"He then defeated the state's attorney general, Democratic nominee Jack Conway, in the general election."
"On September 8, 2015, Bevin met with Davis in the jail and later attended a rally organized by Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee celebrating her subsequent release."
"==== Fiscal issues ====
Bevin advocated shifting the state's tax code away from ""productivity"" taxes, such as income taxes, to ""consumption taxes"" such as sales taxes, a move that Conway called ""regressive""."
"He then attacked Conway, who refused to appeal the 2014 federal court opinion that Kentucky's defense of marriage amendment violated the federal constitution: ""Jack Conway's failure to do his job and defend our laws in Kentucky disqualifies him from being elected to the office of Governor."""
"Bevin later compromised with the state's public college and university presidents to reduce the cuts to 2 percent, but Attorney General Andy Beshear sued to stop the cuts entirely."
"By mid-October 2013, McConnell's campaign indicated it would look beyond Bevin and focus its advertising against Alison Lundergan Grimes, the frontrunner in the race for the Democratic senatorial nomination, calling her ""my real opponent""."
"Bevin joined a field that included Commissioner of Agriculture James Comer, former Louisville Councilman Hal Heiner, and former Kentucky Supreme Court Justice Will T. Scott."
"In April 2018, he ""guaranteed"" that the teachers' labor stoppage had resulted in unsupervised children being sexually assaulted, physically harmed, or exposed to poison and drugs."
The Republican-controlled Senate countered with a proposal that hewed closely to Bevin's original budget.
"Bevin was renominated by the Republican Party of Kentucky in a primary election on May 21, 2019, as its candidate for governor in 2019, while Kentucky's outgoing Attorney General Andy Beshear, son of Bevin's predecessor Steve Beshear, won the Democratic nomination."
"He became wealthy in the investment business and moved to Louisville, Kentucky, in 1999."
"Otherwise you don't go there."""
"His proposed alternatives included allowing insurance providers to compete across state lines, capping damages awarded for pain and suffering, allowing individuals to purchase health insurance with pre-tax earnings, and providing federal block grants to states to allow them to cover individuals with pre-existing conditions."
"In an unusual Saturday session in January 2017, the Kentucky General Assembly passed seven fast-tracked bills on key Republican legislative priorities."
"To avoid disruptions in the children's schooling, the Bevins opted not to move into the Kentucky Governor's Mansion immediately after Bevin's election as governor in November 2015, instead waiting until after the school year ended in August 2016."
"After graduation, he attended Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, on a partial ROTC scholarship."
"Ultimately, Conway carried only 14 of Kentucky's 120 counties, and observers wrote that the loss likely ended his political career."
He appeared onstage with McConnell on a few occasions during the general election campaign but steadfastly refused to explicitly endorse him.
"Although he carried little more than liability insurance on the business and his losses were compounded by looters who stole 4,500 bells, Bevin vowed to rebuild, telling the Hartford Courant, ""I'm a Bevin, and Bevins make bells."""

"On November 11, 2019, Republican U.S. Senator Mitch McConnell announced that ""all indications are"" Beshear will be the next Governor of Kentucky."
"Bevin filed suit against Planned Parenthood in February, claiming it had illegally performed 23 abortions without a license; the suit said Planned Parenthood's licensure application was deficient because it did not include agreements with a hospital and ambulance service to transport and care for patients in case of complications, as required by state law, and that Beshear's inspector general was wrong in instructing the organization to begin performing abortions before the license was approved."

"Bevin contended that Conway's decision cost Kentucky taxpayers $2.3 million, citing the cost of private attorneys that Beshear hired to defend the amendment in Conway's place."
"The Lexington Herald-Leader noted that Bevin had trailed in every publicly released poll, and political analyst Stephen Voss said that, given the consistency of the data, ""Bevin needs a sudden shift in voter preferences if he hopes to win this contest, and he may be dragging down some of his Republican ticket mates as well."
Bevin was endorsed by FreedomWorks and conservative talk radio hosts Mark Levin and Glenn Beck.
"Bevin became irritated with Keith's reporting and refused to answer questions from him at subsequent press conferences; he did not buy ads on WAVE, despite running ads on Louisville's other three network broadcast stations."

During the campaign, Bevin criticized the Affordable Care Act and called for repealing it in its entirety."
"While McConnell's charges involved delinquent taxes against Bevin Brothers Manufacturing, Theo Keith of Louisville's WAVE reported in June that Bevin had been late at least 10 times paying property taxes on his vacation homes in Maine and Louisiana between 2002 and 2009."
Those pardoned included a man whose brother threw a fundraising party to relieve the debt left over from Bevin's defeat and also a man convicted of raping a nine-year-old girl and who had served only one year of a twenty-three year sentence.

Bevin signed all seven bills into law on January 9.
"==== McConnell's challenges ====
McConnell launched ads accusing Bevin of taking taxpayer bailouts, citing his acceptance of state grants to rebuild Bevin Brothers."
The Republican-controlled Kentucky House condemned Bevin's comments and overrode his veto of a law that increased classroom spending.
I would reverse that immediately.
He then referenced Bevin's statements in a May Republican debate citing studies suggesting educational gains effected by the federal Head Start Program are lost by the third grade.
"After the Center for Medical Progress released series of videos purporting to show Planned Parenthood representatives illegally negotiating the sale of body parts from aborted fetuses, Bevin pledged that, ""As governor, I will direct my secretary of the Cabinet for Health and Family Services not to distribute federal taxpayer dollars from that department to Planned Parenthood clinics."
"By 2015, Bevin said all of his children were homeschooled."
A bad idea.

...
"Associated Press reporter Adam Beam wrote that the Davis case ""ignited the passions of religious conservatives in an already conservative state"", and University of Kentucky political science professor Stephen Voss opined that a campaign focused on cultural and social issues would be ""bad for Conway""."
"Bevin refused to concede, citing what he called ""irregularities"" and referring to a ""process""; court approval would be needed for a full recount, and Kentucky's election recount law does not appear to apply for gubernatorial elections."
"On March 11, 2019, Bevin signed a bill into law removing the permit requirement to carry a concealed firearm in the state, becoming the 16th state to enact such legislation after South Dakota and Oklahoma had done it earlier in the year."

He opposed tax increases and the allocation of federal earmarks.
"In 1990, he completed a six-week Junior Officer Maintenance Course at Fort Knox in Kentucky."
"The WAVE video also showed an attendee asking Bevin if he would support the legalization of cockfighting in Kentucky, to which he replied, ""I support the people of Kentucky exercising their right, because it is our right to decide what it is that we want to do, and not the federal government's."
"Heiner apologized for any role members of his campaign may have had in perpetuating the accusations against Comer, but the story touched off a feud between Heiner and Comer that some analysts predicted would benefit Bevin."
"Just before 3:00 a.m. on April 14, negotiators announced they had reached a compromise that would cut public universities' budgets by 4.5 percent over the biennium instead of the 9 percent requested by Bevin and implement a performance-based funding model in 2017."
"Bevin urged the audience to emulate Winston Churchill rather than Neville Chamberlain, saying, ""It's a slippery slope...."

They will continue to be on it until we come up with a solution.
"I will not support it."""
"Bevin responded with ads accusing McConnell of voting for higher taxes, government bailouts, increases in the debt ceiling, and confirmation of liberal judicial nominees."
McConnell's chief of staff said Bevin requested the meeting and McConnell never asked Bevin to enter the race.
"After his election as governor, he announced he would hold an invitation-only inaugural worship service at Frankfort's Buck Run Baptist Church, but the service was moved to the Frankfort Convention Center and the invitation requirement was dropped following an ""overwhelming response from the public""."
"McConnell's campaign then launched another ad, based on a story published by BuzzFeed, claiming Bevin had failed to disclose a federal tax lien when applying for the state grant to rebuild his family business, which could be a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail and a $2,000 fine under Connecticut law."
"He called for massive spending cuts in the federal bureaucracy, specifically the Department of Education and the Veterans Administration, and for reforming eligibility requirements for entitlement programs, including raising age requirements, imposing means tests, and ending federal benefits to illegal immigrants."
"On election day, Bevin garnered 125,759 votes – 35.4% of the vote – to McConnell's 213,666 votes (60.2%); the remaining votes were scattered among three lower-profile candidates."
Still another account of the VVS appearance said he had spoken without notes or teleprompter.
"""During the candidates first public appearance together on June 19, 2015, Conway promised to increase funding for early childhood education and expand its availability for those in poverty."

"Scott Lasley, a political science professor at Western Kentucky University and chairman of the Warren County Republican Party, criticized Bevin's appearance at the rally, saying, ""Either they were totally unvetted and unprepared for it, which says a lot about the campaign and its ability to compete at this level, or...they think that message is going to be receptive."
"I am not and have never been a supporter of cockfighting or any other forms of animal cruelty."""
The family also retains their pre-election home in Louisville.
The Bevins attend Southeast Christian Church in Louisville.
"Republicans agreed to fund a Democratic proposal for a scholarship program providing free community college tuition for qualified students, relented on their demands to stop state funding for Planned Parenthood, and spared the state's prevailing wage guidelines."
"In an email to reporters, Bevin's communications director said, ""Matt has been consistent on the issue of Medicaid expansion from day one."

"In late June 2012, Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy announced that Bevin Brothers would receive $100,000 in grants from the state's Small Business Express program to assist in the rebuilding effort."
"Lawyers interviewed by the Lexington Herald-Leader said it would have been legal for Bevin to change the content of the letter, but not the accompanying facts and financial data."

"During the campaign, Bevin criticized McConnell for voting in favor of those actions as a senator."
"McConnell was not in attendance, but a spokesperson read a letter again endorsing Bevin."
Bevin narrowly lost his re-election campaign to Beshear.
"Democratic representatives Denver Butler and Jim Gooch also switched their party affiliation to Republican in December, reducing the Democratic majority to 50–46 for the beginning of the first General Assembly of Bevin's governorship, and giving Republicans a chance to evenly split the chamber's 100 seats by sweeping the special elections."
"On March 12, House Democrats released their own budget, which sustained most of the cuts to executive agencies in Bevin's budget, but exempted public universities from any cuts."

"The clinic claimed it had been given permission to perform the procedures by Beshear's inspector general just prior to Bevin taking office, but nonetheless halted the procedures on January 28."
Davis was confined to the Carter County jail for six days on contempt of court charges for refusing to comply with Bunning's order.
"However, Kentucky Senate President Robert Stivers and other Republican members of the Kentucky state legislature expressed skepticism of Bevin's voter fraud claim and urged Bevin on November 7 to concede if the recanvass does not go in his favor."
"Heiner said the survey was a negative push poll, but Bevin insisted it was a legitimate poll."
"State House Speaker Greg Stumbo, viewed as one of Bevin's main political antagonists, was one of several House Democrats defeated in the election; Bevin remarked, ""'good riddance'...he will not be missed one bit."
The Herald-Leader further noted that Bevin had not signed some previous investor letters.
The appointments of two Democratic state representatives – John Tilley as Secretary of the Justice and Public Safety Cabinet and Tanya Pullin to a state judgeship – reduced the party's majority in the House and set up special elections that gave Republicans a chance to win their seats from Democrats.

"You do this all the time in business."""
Analyst Ronnie Ellis speculated that the Republicans' victories set the stage for the party to take control of the state House of Representatives in the November 2016 elections.
"A supporter of congressional term limits, Bevin signed a pledge authored by the non-profit U.S. Term Limits stating that, if elected, he would co-sponsor and vote for a bill restricting individuals to three terms in the U.S. House of Representatives and two terms in the U.S. Senate."

"I don't even remember him saying that."""
"On May 1, Bevin released the promised jobs plan, which called for a gradual reduction of the federal corporate tax rate to 10% over five years, allowing companies to return overseas profits to the United States with a 10% tax assessment, and passage of a federal right-to-work law."
"In the aftermath of McConnell negotiating a deal to end the 16-day government shutdown in 2013, the Senate Conservatives Fund endorsed Bevin."

"He grew up in the rural town of Shelburne, New Hampshire, in a small farmhouse heated by wood-fired stoves."
"Other bills Bevin signed into law included a ""Blue Lives Matter"" bill making it a hate crime to attack a police officer, placing Planned Parenthood at the least priority for funding, and removing restrictions on local governments authorizing charter schools."

"Observers from both parties praised Bevin's selection of experienced, relatively moderate individuals for his cabinet, including his former rival, Hal Heiner, as Secretary of the Education and Workforce Cabinet and former University of Kentucky football standout Derrick Ramsey as his Secretary of Labor."
"Federal Election Commission records showed no evidence of contributions by Bevin to McConnell's campaign, and a McConnell advisor cited by Bevin to corroborate his support refused to do so when contacted by Insider Louisville."
"Go back and look at what I said."""
"He received criticism, including from NBC weather forecaster Al Roker, who referred to Bevin as a ""nitwit governor"" the next day."
"Bevin claimed, without evidence, that ""thousands of absentee ballots that were illegally counted"", people were ""incorrectly turned away"" at the polls, ""a number of [voting] machines that didn't work properly"", and ballots were stored in open boxes."
Bevin lost his re-election campaign to Kentucky Attorney General Andy Beshear in a close race.

"Organizers of the event, which was closed to the media, said there was ""never any ambiguity"" regarding its purpose, and WAVE in Louisville published an undercover video from the event showing that Bevin was the third speaker; the speaker who immediately preceded Bevin said the rally was held ""for the sole purpose of legalizing gamecock fighting at the state level."""
"Bevin responded with a web site tying Conway to President Barack Obama, who was very unpopular in Kentucky, saying that Conway would support environmental regulations that harm the coal industry and support the Affordable Care Act, which was also unpopular in the state, despite its nationally praised insurance exchange."
Scorsone also said the clinic served the public interest by providing abortion services for the eastern half of the state.
"The administration appealed Scorsone's decision, and on June 15, a three-judge panel from the Kentucky Court of Appeals ruled Scorsone's decision in error and issued a temporary injunction against EMW, prohibiting them from performing abortions until and unless the case was eventually resolved in its favor."
"During his remarks at an October 29 Restore America rally, Bevin said ""I say with all due respect to a lot of folks who might say otherwise, sometimes we might need to get over it and move on."
He was assigned to the 25th Field Artillery Regiment of the Army's 5th Mechanized Infantry Division at Fort Polk in Louisiana.
Bevin was never charged.
"He repeated his call to eliminate the inheritance tax and added that the state should ""aim for"" the elimination of corporate taxes."
"Alessi then cited Bevin's February promise to end the Medicaid expansion ""immediately"", to which Bevin replied, ""I said I would address it."
McConnell's third ad in as many weeks targeted Bevin for falsely claiming on his LinkedIn page that he attended a seminar affiliated with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
"In September 2016, the Kentucky Supreme Court issued a 5–2 decision reversing the Franklin Circuit Court's ruling and agreeing with Beshear that Bevin lacked the authority to make mid-year budget cuts without the approval of the General Assembly."
It's the same as pornography.
"As of May 2016, he had one of the lowest approval ratings among United States governors."
"At a September campaign stop at a local Dairy Queen, Bevin promised only to ""tweak"" Beshear's Medicaid expansion."
"They have desensitized people to the value of human life, to the dignity of women, to the dignity of human decency."""
"Bevin said that he had been paying the lien in $5,000 installments prior to the fire that destroyed the business, a condition he said was allowed by the grant application, but after the fire, the Internal Revenue Service suspended the payments."

"Public elementary and secondary education were spared from the cuts, as were social workers, public defenders, corrections officers, and Kentucky State Police employees, all of whom received raises under Bevin's proposal."
"On November 13, 2018, Bevin said that a cultural popularity of death, as evidenced by zombie television shows, is to blame for mass shootings, and that gun regulation is not the solution."
"Bevin made a $200,000 combined television and radio ad buy to defend himself against the ads and began a telephone survey that touted his conservative credentials while highlighting Heiner's past positions on issues such as gun control before asking how these statements affect the person's view of each candidate."
"In his final month of office, Bevin pardoned or commuted the sentences of 428 people, including 336 mostly white drug offenders, but some convicted of crimes such as murder, manslaughter, and rape."
"In total, Keith estimated that Bevin had paid about $1,800 in penalties for late tax payments."
"At a statewide Lincoln Day dinner, Bevin showed a humorous montage of him supporting McConnell, including staged scenes of him waking up in a McConnell T-shirt, applying McConnnell bumper stickers to his vehicle, and getting a ""Team Mitch"" tattoo."
"Born in Denver, Colorado, and raised in Shelburne, New Hampshire, Bevin earned a bachelor's degree at Washington and Lee University in 1989, then served four years of active duty in the U.S. Army, attaining the rank of captain."
"McConnell's next ad featured Bevin telling an audience ""I have no tax delinquency problem, nor have I ever,"" then claimed his businesses had failed to pay taxes eight times and Bevin was late on a tax payment on his $1.2 million vacation home in Greenwood, Maine, in 2007."
"Bevin responded, ""And create what degree of chaos?"""
"Flanked by Senator Richard Blumenthal, Bevin announced in July 2012 that he would sell souvenirs including T-shirts, and bells and bricks salvaged from the gutted factory, to raise additional funds for rebuilding."
"These bills included two that restricted abortion (one of which was a 20-week abortion ban), and three that reduced the power of labor unions, including a bill making Kentucky the 27th right-to-work state."
I was thinking about what I was going to say.
But you pay the taxes.
"Bevin defended his comments and attacked the Lexington Herald-Leader and Courier Journal, and WKYT as ""clowns"", referring to a comment by Barack Obama in 2009 about Washington D.C. coming to a halt after a dusting of snow when Chicago would not have canceled school."
"But at this point, we're going to have to look at them in totality."
"During his matriculation, he studied abroad in Japan and became fluent in Japanese."
"In a series of December 2015 executive orders, Bevin removed the names of county clerks from state marriage licenses, as well as reversed orders by Beshear that restored voting rights for non-violent felons who had completed their sentences and raised the minimum wage for some state workers to $10.10 per hour."
He opposed U.S. intervention in the Syrian Civil War and the disbursement of foreign aid to countries that deny basic freedoms to their citizens or are guilty of human rights violations.
"EMW ceased performing abortions March 9, pending the outcome of the lawsuit."
"Criminalizing behavior, if it's part of the heritage of this state, is in my opinion a bad idea."
I'm not gonna give you specifics at this time.

By the late 1960s Morris was being featured in museum shows in America but his work and writings drew criticism from Clement Greenberg.
In 1971 Morris designed an exhibition for the Tate Gallery that took up the whole central sculpture gallery with ramps and cubes.
"In Morris' book, Continuous Project Altered Daily: The Writings of Robert Morris, the artist includes a collaborative project with the art critic G. Roger Denson in which he lampoons the criticism of his work published over the course of his career up to the early 1990s."
"(…) his theater is one of negation: negation of the avant-gardist concept of originality, negation of logic and reason, negation of the desire to assign uniform cultural meanings to diverse phenomena; negation of a worldview that distrusts the unfamiliar and the unconventional."
"He was regarded as having been one of the most prominent theorists of Minimalism along with Donald Judd, but also made important contributions to the development of performance art, land art, the Process Art movement, and installation art."
He married dancer Simone Forti in 1955 and later divorced in 1962.
"Between 1948 and 1950, Morris studied engineering at the University of Kansas."
He then studied art at both the University of Kansas and at Kansas City Art Institute as well as philosophy at Reed College [1].
Critic Amelia Jones argued that the body poster was a statement about hyper-masculinity and the stereotypical idea that masculinity equated to homophobia.
I've never seen such a hysterical gang of assassins.
"Body Bob threw the I-Box at the Major who then bent Stagette out of shape with the Corner Piece and Blind smeared cup grease on Dirt Macher's … wait a minute, Ignatz."
Robert Morris's art is fundamentally theatrical.
In 1964 Morris devised and performed two celebrated performance artworks 21.3 in which he lip syncs to a reading of an essay by Erwin Panofsky and Site with Carolee Schneemann.
He interrupted his studies in 1951-52 to serve with the United States Army Corps of Engineers in Arizona and Korea.
"What, you read that ticket about our 'new tone of ironic self-reference?'"
The idea that art making was a record of a performance by the artist (drawn from Hans Namuth’s photos of Pollock at work) in the studio led to an interest in dance and choreography.
And what?
"Untitled (Pink Felt) (1970), for example, is composed of dozens of sliced pink industrial felt pieces that have been dropped on the floor."
"""Hey, what's going on, Ignatz?"
Ansätze zu einer Kunstgeschichte als Mediengeschichte article in German by Thomas Dreher on the competing theories on art by Allan Kaprow and Robert Morris
"Robert Morris (February 9, 1931 – November 28, 2018) was an American sculptor, conceptual artist and writer."
"Morris enrolled at Hunter College in New York (his masters thesis was on the work of Brâncuși) and in 1966 published a series of influential essays ""Notes on Sculpture"" in Artforum."
"Numerous museums have hosted solo exhibitions of his work, including the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York (1970), the Art Institute of Chicago (1980), the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago and the Newport Harbor Art Museum (1986), and the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. (1990)."
Morris moved to New York City in 1960.
Everybody is rolling on the floor and laughing.
"The windows, which depict the ripples of a pebble dropped in water, were produced by Ateliers Duchemin glassmakers and placed in restored romanesque window lights around the cathedral building."
In 1963 he had an exhibition of Minimal sculptures at the Green Gallery in New York that was written about by Donald Judd.
"In 1967 Morris created Steam, an early piece of Land Art."
"At the time of his death in late November 2018 an exhibit of Morris' recent work ""Banners and Curses"" was on display at the Leo Castelli Gallery in New York City."
"== Death ==
Morris died on November 28, 2018, in Kingston, New York, from pneumonia at the age of 87."
"He created the Robert Morris Observatory in the Netherlands, a ""modern Stonehenge"", which identifies the solstices and the equinoxes."
"As one commentator, Brian Winkenweder, wrote:
""In his reply [to Denson's questions], Morris compartmentalized diverse aspects of his oeuvre into nine, cleverly-named alter-egos such as Body Bob, Major Minimax, Lil Dahlink Felt, Mirror Stagette, Dirt Macher and Blind."
"How could you think such a thing, Ignatz?"
Themes of the work were often fear of nuclear war.
Morris lived and worked in New York.
"The chapter, entitled ""Robert Morris Replies to Roger Denson (Or Is That a Mouse in My Paragon?)"", lists thirteen questions submitted by Denson, with each question representing the criticism of Morris' work written by a different unnamed critic responding to a specific exhibition, installation, or art work."
"In 2002, Morris designed a set of seventeen pale blue and beige-coloured stained-glass windows for the medieval Maguelone Cathedral, near Montpelier in France."
"The following year, also at Green Gallery, Morris exhibited a suite of large-scale polyhedron forms constructed from 2 x 4s and gray-painted plywood."
His work became larger scale taking up the majority of the gallery space with series of modular units or piles of earth and felt.
"He published a photo of himself dressed in S&M gear in an advertisement in Artforum, similar to one by Lynda Benglis, with whom Morris had collaborated on several videos."
You are so surly today.
"During the 1950s, Morris' furthered his interest in dance while living in San Francisco with his wife, the dancer and choreographer Simone Forti."
"Instead of answering the questions, Morris has written an elaborate, comically absurd, satirical narrative that in many ways epitomizes the ""only possible response"" to criticism that had become fashionable in the so-called ""demise of criticism"" that some writers of the 1980s and 1990s heralded following the ""deconstruction of logocentrism"" postulated by the post-structuralist theorist Jacques Derrida."
"In New York City, Morris began to explore the work of Marcel Duchamp, making conceptual pieces such as Box with the Sound of its Own Making (1961) and Fountain (1963)."
"While living in California, Morris also came into contact with the work of La Monte Young, John Cage, and Warner Jepson with whom he and first wife Simone Forti collaborated."
"== Exhibitions ==
Morris' first exhibition of paintings was held in 1958 at the Dilexi Gallery in San Francisco."

"The Braves played Phillips in two games in September 1946, but the remainder of his  playing career would be spent in minor league baseball and winter baseball."
"On October 1, 1943, he was acquired by the Boston Braves and spent the entire 1944 campaign in Boston, playing in 140 games and hitting .258 in 489 at-bats."
"However, he was declared a free agent by Commissioner of Baseball Kenesaw Mountain Landis after the 1939 season and was barred from re-signing with Detroit."
Among those he signed for the Orioles was future MLB second baseman and manager Davey Johnson.
He eventually joined the Reds' organization and was called to the majors in the middle of the 1942 season.

Convertini would travel to various villages on bike or on foot or even on horseback with his backpack in order to go around evangelizing and aiding people (covering miles in order to visit far-reaching villages).
It was not long before Convertini gained fame among the people for his unconditional and unbiased services to all people; he also mastered the Bengali language in order to better communicate with the people.
Convertini left for India from the port in Genova on 7 December 1927 and arrived in Bombay on 26 December before taking a train to Calcutta.
Convertini commenced his novitiate period in Shillong under the direction of the bishop Stefano Ferrando and was also a disciple of both Costantino Vendrame and Archbishop Louis Mathias (he passed his theological and philosophical studies despite some difficulties).
Convertini became titled as Venerable on 20 January 2017 after Pope Francis signed a decree that acknowledged that Convertini had led a life of heroic virtue.
The C.C.S. later validated the diocesan process on 19 June 2006 after the cause was transferred to Rome while the department received the official Positio dossier in 2009 for evaluation.
This enabled him to create an air of interreligious dialogue and tolerance.
"The formal introduction to the cause came on 27 July 1998 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official ""nihil obstat"" (no objections to the cause) decree and titling Convertini as a Servant of God."
He was also considered one of the few missionaries who could enter into Hindi or Muslim homes due to the strong rapport he fostered with people of other religions.
He was freed upon the war's conclusion but after returning to his homeland on 15 November 1918 suffered from severe meningitis therefore forcing him to recover in isolation in the hospital in Cuneo; his poor health made it worse since he looked skeletal upon his release.
Nine theologians voiced their confirmation for the cause at their meeting held on 11 November 2015 while the C.C.S. cardinal and bishop members also issued an affirmative vote to the cause on 10 January 2017.
But this newfound call to enter the priesthood tore him since he was divided between accepting God's call and his love for his girlfriend.

"Takanohana was absent from this tournament and Musashimaru won it after a five way playoff with a score of 11–4, the lowest number of wins needed to take a top division title since 1972."
The couple have one son.
"== Retirement from sumo ==
In November 2002 Musashimaru tore a tendon in his left wrist, an injury which proved to be career-ending."
"While attending Waianae High School in Waianae he played American football and was offered a scholarship to Pasadena City College, but he also had success in Greco-Roman wrestling, and his wrestling coach encouraged him to give sumo a try."
"He was born in American Samoa, before moving to Hawaii at the age of 10."
"At 18 he moved to Japan and made his professional sumo debut in 1989, reaching the top makuuchi division in 1991."
"Forced to withdraw from that tournament, the chronic problem restricted him to just a handful of appearances in the whole of 2003."
"In December 2012 it was announced that he would inherit the prestigious Musashigawa (武蔵川) name upon his old stablemaster's retirement in February 2013, at which time he opened his own stable of wrestlers, Musashigawa."
"In an interview on November 16, 2003, he revealed that he had also injured his neck while playing American football in high school and had been unable to move his left shoulder properly."
"In 2001, although he did not have the injury problems of the previous year, he lost two playoffs to Takanohana in January and May, and had a mere 9–6 record in September, giving away five kinboshi to maegashira ranked wrestlers, an all-time record for a single tournament."
He made komusubi in May 1992 and sekiwake in July.
"He did not compete again until November, when after suffering his fourth defeat on the seventh day, he announced his retirement."
"In 2002, with Takanohana sidelined through injury, Musashimaru was dominant."
This kachi-koshi run ended just one tournament short of Kitanoumi's top division record.
Look Japan.
"He did not initially acquire a permanent elder (toshiyori) name, going instead under the name of Musashimaru Oyakata, which as a former yokozuna he was entitled to do for a period of five years after retirement."
"He usually used a migi-yotsu (left hand outside, right hand inside) grip."
"He moved to Japan and joined former yokozuna Mienoumi's Musashigawa stable in June 1989, initially on a trial basis only."
"There was little of the controversy that surrounded previous promotion drives by foreign wrestlers such as Konishiki, and Musashimaru's record of never having missed a bout in his career was praised by the Yokozuna Deliberation Council."
"Musashimaru has remained in the sumo world as an oyakata, or coach."
"He showed great consistency, never missing any bouts through injury and always getting at least eight wins."
"In October 2008 he began using the name Furiwake (ふりわけ), and he then switched to the Ōshima (大島) elder name of former ozeki Asahikuni in August 2012."
"An amiable personality, his fan base was helped by a surprising facial resemblance to Japanese warrior hero Saigō Takamori."
"""Much Ado about Musashimaru""."
"Musashimaru seemed content just to maintain his rank, not winning another title until November 1996."
"This proved to be successful and he formally made his professional debut that September, adopting the shikona or ring name of Musashimaru Kōyō."
"He moved up the ranks quickly, becoming an elite sekitori wrestler in July 1991 upon promotion to the jūryō division."
"== Personal life ==
In April 2008 Musashimaru married a hula dance instructor from Tokyo and the wedding ceremony took place in August 2008 in Hawaii."
"This is not to be confused with the stable he fought out of as an active wrestler, which has since been renamed Fujishima stable."
"The family moved to Oahu, Hawaii when he was ten years old."
"During his career he had won a total of twelve top division championships, one more than Akebono, and also won over 700 top division bouts, one of only six wrestlers to have achieved that feat to date."
"Earlier in his career he favored pushing and thrusting (tsuki/oshi) techniques, but he also began to fight more on the mawashi, simply wearing his smaller opponents out with his huge inertia."
"Musashimaru was the last Hawaiian wrestler in sumo, ending a dynasty that began with Takamiyama in 1964 and at one point in 1996 saw four from the islands ranked in the top division."
"However, he was unable to gain the successive championships needed to become a yokozuna."
"After a respectable 12–3 performance in his yokozuna debut, he won two further titles that year."
"Akebono returned to form in 2000, and Musashimaru was also sidelined with injury in May."
"After reaching the rank of ōzeki in 1994 his progress seemed to stall, but in 1999 he became only the second foreign-born wrestler in history to reach the sport's highest rank of yokozuna."
"He won just one title that year, in September, although it was one of his most impressive results as he won his first 14 matches, just failing on the last day to become the first wrestler in four years to win with a perfect record."
"His sheer 235 kg (518 lb) bulk combined with 1.92 m (6 ft 3+1⁄2 in) of height made him a formidable opponent, and he was remarkably consistent and injury-free for most of his career."
"Overshadowed by new yokozuna Asashōryū, he entered the July tournament but pulled out after just six days."
"== Fighting style ==
In addition to his great size and strength, Musashimaru had a low center of gravity and excellent balance, which made him very difficult to beat."
"However, in January 2000 he had to pull out of the tournament with an injury on the fourth day, bringing to an end his record run of 55 consecutive tournaments with a majority of wins, dating from his 6–1 score in the makushita division in November 1990."
"Musashimaru Kōyō (Japanese: 武蔵丸 光洋, Hepburn: Musashimaru Kōyō, born May 2, 1971, as Fiamalu Penitani) is a Japanese former professional sumo wrestler."
"Musashimaru took his first top division championship (yūshō) in July 1994 with a perfect 15–0 record, but in the following tournament he could manage only 11 wins and Takanohana overtook him to become yokozuna at the end of the year, joining Akebono who had become the first foreign born yokozuna in 1993."
He had to wait until November 2001 for his ninth title.
"== Ōzeki ==
Musashimaru was ranked as an ōzeki for 32 tournaments."
He reached the top makuuchi division just two tournaments later in November 1991.
"Although he missed most of the January 2002 tournament after injuring himself against Kyokushūzan on the third day, he won three tournaments that year, making 2002 his most successful year since 1999."
Musashimaru won over 700 top division bouts and took twelve top division tournament championships during his career.
"His most common winning technique or kimarite was oshidashi (push out), closely followed by yorikiri (force out)."

"== Expansion ==
The initial stages were not easy."
"A few months later, worn out by grief, her mother also died."
"The duties of the foundress became intense, consisting of travels and hard work, interwoven with joys and sacrifices for the formation of new communities."

On 30 August 1685, with the approval of the Bishop of Viterbo, Cardinal Giulio Cesare Sacchetti, and the collaboration of two friends, Gerolama Coluzzelli and Porzia Bacci, Rosa left her father's home to begin her first school."
"Cardinal Marcantonio Barbarigo, Bishop of Montefiascone, had the insight to understand the Viterbo project and he invited Venerini to come to his diocese to give advice on the administration of schools in the diocese and to help train teachers."
"After the openings in Viterbo and Montefiascone, other schools were started throughout the region of Lazio."
"== Death and legacy ==
Rose Venerini died at the community at the Basilica of San Marco in Rome on the evening of 7 May 1728."
"After Venerini's first contacts with the Dominican friars at the Sanctuary of Our Lady of the Oak Tree, near Viterbo, she chose to follow the spirituality of Ignatius of Loyola under the direction of the Jesuits, especially Ignatius Martinelli, who became her spiritual director."
"From 1692 to 1694, she opened ten schools in Montefiascone and the villages surrounding Lake Bolsena."
"With her characteristic strength, Rosa continued on the path that she had undertaken."
"According to her first biographer, Girolamo Andreucci, Venerini made a vow to consecrate her life to God at the age of seven."
"Her remains were entombed in the nearby Jesuit Church of the Gesù, so loved by her."
"Venerini was invited to Rome in 1706 to establish a school, but the attempt was a failure, which caused her to wait six long years before regaining the trust of the authorities."
"The Sisters went to the United States in 1909, primarily to help the Italian immigrants to that country, establishing the first day care centers in many cities of the Northeastern United States."
"From his marriage to Marzia Zampichetti, of an ancient family of the city, four children were born: Domenico, Maria Maddalena, Rosa and Orazio."
"Her father, Goffredo, originally from Castelleone di Suasa, Ancona, after having completed his medical studies at Rome, moved to Viterbo where he practiced at the major hospital of the city."
"Her brother, Domenico, then died at 27."
"At the end of the morning he addressed these words to Rose: “Signora Rosa, you are doing that which we cannot do."
The three teachers had to face the resistance of clergy who considered the teaching of the catechism as their private office.
"When she had to return to Viterbo to attend to her first school, Venerini entrusted the Montefiascone schools and the teachers to the direction of a young woman, Lucia Filippini, in whom she had seen particular gifts of mind, heart and spirit and whom the cardinal had entrusted with the leadership of the project in his diocese."
He became noted for his work.
Filippini organized the teachers of that diocese as a separate religious congregation known as the Religious Teachers Filippini.
"By then, she had opened more than 40 schools."
"Rosa Venerini (9 February 1656 – 7 May 1728) was a pioneer in the education of women and girls in 17th-century Italy and the foundress of the Religious Teachers Venerini (Italian: Maestre Pie Venerini), a Roman Catholic religious institute of women, often simply called the Venerini Sisters."
"At age twenty, though, Rosa had questions about her own future and chose to accept an offer of marriage; her fiancé, however, died shortly after this."
The first objective of this foundress was to give poor girls a complete Christian formation and to prepare them for life in society.
"On 24 October 1716 the Sisters received a visit by Pope Clement XI, accompanied by eight cardinals, who wanted to observe the lessons."
"In the autumn of that year, on the advice of her father, Venerini entered the Dominican Monastery of St. Catherine, where her aunt was a member of the monastery."

He worked as a prop man before becoming assistant director.

"Lamont always had a tremendous rapport with juvenile performers, and Universal entrusted him with a series of musical-comedy vehicles for the studio's teenage singing star Gloria Jean."
"Lamont directed some of these films, as well as some of the competing ""Buster Brown"" comedies for Universal Pictures release."
"These comedy features were moneymakers for the studio but had no prestige at all, and Lamont bristled at what seemed to be a backward career move."
Some of Lamont's earliest directorial jobs were silent short-subject comedies for Educational Pictures.
He appeared onstage while a teenager and started appearing in films from 1919.

Mahdaoui is of a generation of Arab artists who studied abroad but sought inspiration from their traditional roots.
"When asked about this piece Mahdaoui said,""This drum, transformed into a silent sculpture, has temporarily ceased to be an instrument; it simply exists."
"More importantly, it has renounced its particular voice as part of a collective artistic performance."
"Today he is known as the ""inventor of abstract calligraphy,"" since his designs resemble Arabic letters, but have no literal meaning."
"In 2000, he was also selected by Gulf Air to design the external decoration of its fleet for the airline's fiftieth anniversary."
"Nja Mahdaoui, (born in 1937) is a Tunisian artist known for his use of calligraphy as a graphic art form."
Mahdaoui has tried various traditional and experimental media.
"His 'calligrams evoke infinite pleasures in rhythms, fast or slow, born from tension of the wrist, somewhat in the manner of a melodic flow, rising and fading away""."
The bass drum was created in 1998 with wood and given calligraphic embellishments by Mahdaoui.
"Rose Issa, a curator, has described his work saying, ""Mahdaoui is careful not to emphasize the meaning of words but stresses instead the visual effect of compositions."
"Mahdaoui focused on the poetic quality of Arabic text, and invented a graphic style involving calligraphic works."
Its cultural function - as a catalyst to the senses articulated through formal and improvised melody - has been interrupted.
"On account of his use of calligraphy in art, he is said to be part of the Hurufiyah art movement."

"== Prior to death of blogger ==
Prior to death of Mr. Beheshti, President Mahmud Ahmadinejad planned to visit Evin prison on October 7, 2012 but the judiciary officials postponed the visit."
"== Arrest and death ==
Beheshti was arrested at his home on October 30 by the Cyberpolice (FATA) for what authorities said were ""actions against national security on social networks and Facebook."""
"On October 31 Beheshti ""issued an official letter to the head of the prison""."
"Alaeddin Borujerdi, an ""influential member of Parliament"" at first denied that Beheshti had been tortured in any way but later told the Tabnak Web site that the blogger had been beaten, but died of shock and fear, not torture."
The doctored picture went viral on social media.
"According to Hamid Dabashi he was ""a labourer from a working class family""."
"On 1 December, Iranian's national police chief, Ismael Ahmadi-Moqaddam, stated ""Tehran's FATA should be held responsible for the death of Sattar Beheshti,"" and fired General Saeed Shokrian, commander of FATA (the cybercrimes police unit), for negligence in Beheshti's death, according to the Iranian Labor News Agency."
"On November 10th, Kaleme published the letter."
"But although he ""was regarded as a relatively minor figure"" among Iran's bloggers, according to the New York Times, Beheshti's death ""has provoked outrage among both opponents and supporters of Iran's leaders""."
The number of prisoners who die under torture is much higher than the numbers reported by the media or human rights organizations.
"=== Other countries ===
 The U.S. State Department called on Iran to investigate the murder of Beheshti: ""We are appalled by reports that Iranian authorities tortured and killed blogger and activist Sattar Beheshti during a prison interrogation."

"On November 6, authorities ""told the blogger's family to collect his body""."
"It read: “Beheshti's body bore signs of torture and that he was beaten during interrogations, repeatedly threatened with death, and hung from his limbs from the ceiling."
"Beheshti stated that the judicial system of the Islamic Republic was ""nothing but a slaughterhouse,"" and that ""the sentences and ... the executions carried out ... were not out of a desire for justice – but were aimed at terrorizing the people so that no one will complain."
"Later Javan defended its action by saying they ""did not want to introduce her as a seditionist""."
"One of the members of the parliamentary committee investigating Beheshti's death, Javad Karimi Ghoddusi, has suggested foreigners are responsible for the death."
"Hamid Dashti states Ghodusi claimed that ""BBC Persian may have had something to do with"" Beheshti's death, or that some of the ""political prisoners who had testified publicly that he was tortured may have killed him""."
"Seyyed Sattar Beheshti (Persian: سید ستار بهشتی) was an Iranian blogger who died under suspicious and unclear circumstances  in early November 2012 several days after being arrested by the Iranian Cyber Police unit for criticizing the government of the Islamic Republic on Facebook, and after making a signed complaint of being tortured while in custody."
"Javan newspaper, which is affiliated with the Revolutionary Guard, censored Gohar Esghi's face from a photograph of the meeting."
"On November 13, Abbas Jafari Dolatabadi, Prosecutor-General of Tehran, told reporters that the blogger's case will be sent to the courts for consideration in about 10 daysOfficial statements on the cause of Beheshti's death have been contradictory."
Besheshti had been arrested for a crime no greater than expressing his political opinion online.

"To that effect, he wrestled control of the Portuguese Foreign Investment and Trade Agency (AICEP) from the Ministry of Economics."
"His new strategy for the party was to focus on a few major issues (such as agriculture, tax cuts, fuel prices) in order for CDS-PP to retain conservative voters, who, in the past, supported CDS-PP but voted PSD at election time."
"In his mid-teens (1974–75) he began contributing to the official newspaper of the youth wing of the PSD (which at the time was called Partido Popular Democrático, 'PPD')."

"His father, Nuno Portas, was an influential post-modernist architect, who professed progressive Roman Catholic views."
"However, Freitas do Amaral lost the election and Portas stepped back from politics to launch the ""O Independente"" newspaper project and became its Deputy-Director."
"He first became nationally known at 15 years of age when he wrote a letter-to-the-editor of the daily evening newspaper Jornal Novo that prominently published it under the heading ""Three Betrayals"" (""Três Traições"") directly accusing then president Ramalho Eanes, prime minister Mário Soares and foreign minister Diogo Freitas do Amaral of ""selling out"" Portugal's African colonies in 1974–75."
"In 1987, he co-founded, with Miguel Esteves Cardoso, the weekly newspaper O Independente, which started publication in May 1988 and became known for its innovative editorial concepts as well as for denouncing political scandals, often on the basis of little more than hearsay."
"In 2009 he personally ran for local office in the small municipality of Arouca (population: 20,000) and was elected to the Municipal Assembly significantly boosting CDS-PP's votes in the region."
"He was Deputy Prime Minister from 2013 to 2015, Minister of State and Foreign Affairs from 2011 to 2013, and Minister of Defence from 2002 to 2005, all three times in coalitions of the PSD and his CDS-PP."
"Their half-sister is Catarina Portas, a well-known Portuguese journalist, businesswoman and media personality."
"Through the rest of his mandate that ended in 2015, he raised no major new policy proposals or objections in his capacity as Deputy Prime-Minister, choosing instead to use his economic policy oversight position to travel the world promoting Portuguese companies and products in what appears to have been a continuation of the ""economic diplomacy"" priority he had established as Minister of Foreign Affairs."
"By his own choice, Portas became Minister of State and of Foreign Affairs and secured two more minister slots for the CDS-PP, including the Minister of Agriculture position for his youthful female protégée Assunção Cristas, who would five years later succeed Portas in the CDS-PP party's leadership."
Paulo Portas assumed the responsibility for the defeat and resigned from the party leadership but not from his seat in parliament.
"In 2013, to attract foreign investments, Paulo Portas instituted ""golden visas"" to make it possible for non-EU foreigners to obtain Portuguese residency if they invested at least 500,000 euros in Portuguese real estate."
"Portas' resignation was reported to be an impulsive but genuine gesture of protest, to distance himself from an increasingly unpopular government that went awry."
"In 1993, Paulo Portas said of Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa that he was an unreliable source for O Independente's, and had given an account of a political VIP dinner that had never taken place going as far as inventing that the soup served during the dinner was Vichyssoise."
"Upon taking over the CDS-PP, he immediately sought to energize the party and earn himself name recognition by campaigning in more media-friendly ways and soon became known by his appearances in public events that earned him the nickname ""Paulie of the Market Fairs"" (in Portuguese: ""Paulinho das Feiras"")."
"Despite running under the slogan ""I shall remain"" (in Portuguese: ""Eu fico""), he left City Council shortly afterwards to focus on the 2002 elections."
He was a sporadic panel member in a popular weekly night TV talk show (Raios e Coriscos) and in the Portuguese edition of Crossfire.

"== Early life ==
Paulo Portas was born in Lisbon and grew up in Vila Viçosa."
"In control of the key ministries of Economics, Agriculture, Labor and Social Security (held by his CDS-PP ministers), Paulo Portas came to wield political power far beyond the 12% of the national vote his party received in the 2011 elections."
"By the 1990s he was a widely recognized national figure and stated more than once on TV that he ""did not want to be a politician"" but it would later become apparent that he was, on the contrary, moving full speed towards becoming Portugal's leading conservative politician."
"He would later profess to have been a staunch follower of PPD's founder Francisco Sá Carneiro, who is said to have relished the views of the 14-year-old Paulo Portas and personally sponsored his full PSD membership in 1978."
"In contrast, his older brother Miguel Portas stayed with their father and became a communist and later a leftist."
"=== Early political career, 1986–97 ===
Paulo Portas took his first big step into politics in 1986 with his personal endorsement of presidential candidate Diogo Freitas do Amaral, in support of whom Portas, already a well-known media pundit, campaigned with determination."
"Paulo Portas was the first Minister of Defence to openly move into the fort, which resulted in the closing of most of the historic monument to the public and in new remodeling and upkeep costs for Portas's occupancy."
"Later, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, in 1999 when he was leader of Portugal's Social Democratic Party (PSD), sought an elections alliance with Paulo Portas's CDS-PP that was initially agreed but collapsed shortly."
In Infopédia [Em linha].
"As Minister of Defence, he presided over important reforms of the military, such as abolishing conscription, but his most lasting legacy was the upgrade of military equipment in the context of the 2003 ""Military Programming Law"" that envisaged a major boost in military equipment spending to 5,341 million euros, including two submarines and 260 combat vehicles that would become the subject of much controversy after he left office."
"He is credited with helping his former University colleague Manuel Monteiro gain the leadership of the Centro Democrático Social (CDS) party in 1992 and with coming up with new strategies, such as rebranding the CDS as the People's Party (CDS-PP) in line with several of the major conservative European parties."
"Sá Carneiro died in 1980 and, following a bitter loss in an internal election of the party's youth-wing JSD, Portas quietly left PSD in 1982."
"In 1999, he headed the CDS-PP list to the European Parliament, got elected but only remained in Brussels less than six months."
"By focusing on his duties as Minister of Foreign Affairs, he also managed to distance himself from the difficult decisions related to Portugal's economic austerity program."
"=== Retirement from CDS-PP Party Leadership, 2016 ===
Having ceased his functions as Deputy Prime-Minister on 26 November 2015, Paulo Portas presented himself in Parliament the following day  to take up the position for which he had been elected on 4 October by the Lisbon electoral district."

"Lynch was taken into custody and after a search of his home, items were found that belonged to Pearl Larson, the first victim of the Day Stalker."
"The killer was dubbed the Day Stalker, due to his nature of striking at around mid-day hours."

The fighting and the aftermath of the Napoleonic wars forced Weber to relocate from Wittenberg.
"Weber became a doctor, specializing in anatomy and physiology."
"In 1821, Weber launched a series of experiments on the physics of fluids with his younger brother Wilhelm."
This ratio is known as the Weber fraction.
"In other words, we are able to distinguish the relative difference, not the absolute difference between items."
He was an influential and important figure in the areas of physiology and psychology during his lifetime and beyond.
Ernst Heinrich Weber retired from the University of Leipzig in 1871.
He found that the finest discrimination between weights was when they differed by 8–10%.
He became an assistant in J.C. Clarus’ medical clinic in Leipzig in 1817 and then a professor in comparative anatomy in 1818 at the University of Leipzig.
"In his later life, Weber became less involved in testing and experimenting, although he was still interested in sensory physiology."
"== Early life ==
Ernst Heinrich Weber was born on 24 June 1795 in Wittenberg, Saxony, Holy Roman Empire."
"For example, if you were holding a 100 g block, the second block would need to weigh at least 108 g in order to be distinguishable."
"Weber also suspected that a constant fraction applied for all senses, but is different for each sense."
"Weber’s work made a significant impact on the field of experimental psychology, as he was one of the first scientist to test his ideas on humans."
"He was son to Michael Weber, a professor of theology at the University of Wittenberg."
"When comparing the differences in line length, there must be at least 0.01 difference in order to distinguish the two."
"At a young age, Weber became interested in physics and the sciences after being heavily influenced by Ernst Chladni, a physicist often referred to as the “father of acoustics”."
Weber’s first work with the jnd had to do with differences in weight.
This research was the first detailed account of hydrodynamic principles in the circulation of blood.
"== Publications ==
Weber's work on the tactile senses was published in Latin as De Subtilitate Tactus (1834), and in German as Der Tastsinn und das Gemeingefühl in 1846."
"He stated that the jnd is the ""minimum amount of difference between two weights necessary to tell them apart""."
He went on to receive his MD in 1815 from the University of Leipzig.
"==== Hydrodynamics ====
Weber discovered laws and applied them to circulation."
"Throughout these working relationships, Weber completed research on the central nervous system, auditory system, anatomy and function of brain, circulation, etc., and a large portion of research on sensory physiology and psychology."
"Two of his younger brothers, Wilhelm and Eduard, were also influential in academia, both as scientists with one specializing in physics and the other in anatomy."
Ernst Heinrich Weber (24 June 1795 – 26 January 1878) was a German physician who is considered one of the founders of experimental psychology.
"Or, we can distinguish between stimuli having a constant ratio, not a constant difference."
"Ernst Weber was born into an academic background, with his father serving as a professor at the University of Wittenberg."
Weber completed secondary school at Meissen and began studying medicine at the University of Wittenberg in 1811.
"When comparing music pitch, there must be at least 0.006 vibrations per second difference."
Weber proposed there was a threshold of sensation in each individual.
"Fechner took inspiration from Weber’s Law and developed what we know today as Fechner’s Law, claiming that there was a logarithmic relation between stimulus intensity and perceived intensity."

He had no children.
"His father died in a swimming accident (with the boy on his back), and he was subsequently educated at Oundle School and in Lausanne, Switzerland, thanks to an aunt's sponsorship."

"Son Carl went on to become an economist, responsible for drafting the post-World War II Japanese tax structure, forming the modern Value Added Tax; he also taught economics as a professor at Columbia University."
"It would render her ranch ineffective, therefore she demanded that the railroad purchase the entire property."
"After Timothy’s death in 1877, Sarah moved back to Iowa with her children."
Los Angeles Times Photographic Archive (Collection 1429).
This rail line would allow residents to have a direct rail connection to both San Jose (30 minutes) and San Francisco (60 minutes).
Early in his career these interests focused on the development of Los Altos as a residential commuter community.
"Building on Paul’s experience with electric interurban service in San Jose, Southern Pacific purchased Pacific Electric Railway Company in 1910 and made Paul Vice President of the new acquisition."
"When Southern Pacific wanted to purchase a right of way through the Winchester property, Sarah realized that the section the railroad wanted would cut her property in two, separating her cattle barn from her grazing lands."
"== Los Altos ==
Only months after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire, the Interurban Electrical Railroad purchased a 160-acre tract of ranch land in the Santa Clara Valley owned by Sarah Winchester."
"Four years later he was made President of Southern Pacific, a post he held until his retirement in 1938."
"His siblings included older twin brothers, Carl and Guy, a younger brother, Fred, and a younger sister, Faith."
"He joined all the influential social clubs of the time, including the Pacific Union Club and the Bohemian Club in San Francisco, as well as the Bankers Club in New York."
"== Family ==
He was the third of five children of Timothy and Sarah Sumner Shoup."
"Beginning in 1907, Paul and several business associates formed the Altos Land Company to develop the former Winchester and Merriman ranches as a residential enclave along the Southern Pacific Railroad’s Los Gatos cutoff, then under construction."
"While there, he began his training in managing a railroad."
The Interurban Electrical Railroad was a subsidiary of Southern Pacific.
"As part of this promotion, Paul was unofficially in charge of the development of the electric lines in the City of Los Angeles."
"UCLA Library Special Collections, Charles E. Young Research Library, University of California, Los Angeles."
"Today, a street in Los Angeles today is named for Paul Shoup in recognition of his contributions."
He was given the responsibility for overseeing the complete integration and conversion of the newly combined interurban system from steam to electric trains.
"In between shifts, he tutored individuals in mathematics, and learned telegraphy and stenography, and he continued to write, submitting short pieces to eastern magazines."
"In 1924, during a Bohemian Club meeting, Herbert Hoover urged
the leading western businessmen of the club to consider starting a first-rate business school on the west coast to limit the siphoning of talent to the eastern seaboard."
It is there that he supposedly began creating promotional materials for local fruit and agricultural products that were distributed by Southern Pacific on the east coast.
This left the railroad with an excessive amount of land.
"Guy and Fred joined Paul in careers with Southern Pacific, with Guy becoming an influential company attorney and Fred working for the Pacific Electric Railway Company in Los Angeles."
Shoup gathered his business associates and purchased the excess property from Southern Pacific.
They incorporated as the Altos Land Company for the purposes of developing the area as a residential community marketed to executives and businessmen working in San Francisco.
"This job was short lived, as he moved to the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1891 as a ticket clerk in San Bernardino."
He became a founding member of the San Jose Chamber of Commerce and worked to promote the Santa Clara Valley as an ideal place to live and establish business interests.
"== Activities outside of Southern Pacific Railroad ==
After Shoup retired in 1938, he became President of Southern Californians, later renamed the Merchants and Manufacturers Association, a pro-business, anti-labor political group that was highly influential in Los Angeles and Southern California."
Clark marketed Los Altos as the “Crown of the Peninsula.”
"On April 11, 1906, just one week before the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, it was announced that Shoup was being transferred back to San Francisco as part of his promotion to Assistant General Freight and Passenger Agent for the region."
"In 1925, he was again promoted, this time to Executive Vice President of the company."
Paul’s father was a well-respected attorney in San Bernardino who relocated the family from Iowa in 1872.
"As a result, in 1925, Paul became a founding board member of the Stanford Graduate School of Business."
Carl died in 1898 while still in his early 20s.
In 1920 he was made Vice President of Southern Pacific and assistant to the President.
"Beyond this direct involvement, he played a large role in bringing businesses and people to the town."
"From San Bernardino, Shoup was given a position in San Francisco in the Passenger Department, which began his personal relationship with the San Francisco Bay area."
Paul Shoup is considered the founder of Los Altos because of his personal and professional contributions to the ongoing economic health of the fledgling settlement.
"Paul married Rose Wilson in 1900 in San Francisco and eventually settled in Los Altos with their three children – Carl Sumner Shoup, Jack Wilson Shoup, and Louise Shoup."
Paul sold his interest in the company only to buy back the company in 1913 to prevent it from going into bankruptcy.
"In 1906, Paul Shoup was named Assistant General Manager of Southern Pacific’s local municipal and interurban lines."
"He then played for Iranian club FC Aboomoslem during 1975/76 season where he scored 11 goals, and was captain of Zobahan F.C. in 1976/77 season."

Soon the specialist doctors from Jinnah Hospital reached the Mideast Hospital.
Murtaza was on the verge of rushing home when he received a message from his father asking him to remain abroad where he could mobilise an international campaign for his release.
"When Benazir decided to side with her husband, Murtaza became a strong critic of the PPP government and the ongoing corruption."
There the two sons formed Al-Zulfiqar along with hundreds of Pakistan Peoples Party militants who had escaped Zia's persecution.
The change of judges is one of the many reasons behind the delay in disposal of the present case.
"Dr Memon said, ""I also came out of the vehicle to help my injured leader who was on the ground and I received a bullet in my leg."""
"Ghulam Murtaza Bhutto (Urdu: مِير مُرتضٰی بُھٹّو; 18 September 1954 – 20 September 1996) was a Pakistani politician and leader of al-Zulfiqar, a Pakistani left-wing militant organization."
Zia had deposed the populist Bhutto regime in a military coup in July 1977.
The same court also pardoned six workers of the Pakistan People's Party Shaheed Bhutto in the same case.
"The acquitted included Mazhar Memon, Asghar Ali, Asif Ali Jatoi, Mehmood Bhallai, Ghulam Mustafa Chandio and Akhter Ali Mirani."
"""Who killed Murtaza Bhutto?""."
Murtaza Bhutto died at 11:45 p.m. but his death was not announced by the hospital authorities until 12:25 a.m.
"In the span of 15 years, however, Murtaza managed to gain considerable notoriety for a brand of politics that has moved in a direction that was diametrically opposed to Benazir's."
The personnel of the law enforcement agencies cocked their guns and confiscated the cameras of photographers.
"His thesis dealt with the spread of nuclear weapons in general, and the implications of India's nuclear weapons on Pakistan in particular."
"One, however, clung to the helicopter."
"Ahmed, Khaled (3 October 2015)."
Bhutto was hanged by the Zia regime after a closed military trial.
"The AZO, however, went on to earn the title of terrorist organisation due to its various terrorist activities throughout the country, a label which dogged Murtaza till he died."
"Murtaza went on to attend Christ Church Oxford, his father's alma mater, for a three-year Master of Letters (MLitt) degree course."
"""There would be trouble if the Police tries to arrest me without a warrant,"" he had declared."
"The police claimed that they reached the Bhutto's residence at number 70 Clifton, at 8:30 p.m., to arrest him."
"Some eyewitnesses said that Bhutto, after getting out of his car, challenged the policemen to shoot him."
"Anwar tells of an excited Murtaza who, while he had early advised Tipu on taking the aircraft to Damascus or Tripoli went into pragmatic overdrive once the plane landed in Kabul due to a shortage of fuel."
"The Al-Zulfiqar Organization (AZO) was born at this point, and disgruntled elements among the younger members of the PPP, disappointed in the party's leadership, flocked to Murtaza's side."
"The policemen suddenly opened fire on Bhutto, seriously injuring him."
"In 1972, Murtaza went off to Harvard University where he took his bachelor's degree."
"Ali Bhutto's two sons, Murtaza and Shahnawaz went into exile in Afghanistan which was at that time controlled by communist revolutionary government of Babrak Karmal."
Return fire by the police party caused fatal injuries to Bhutto and his supporters.
"Zardari was arrested and indicted for Murtaza's murder, but acquitted in 2008."
Two injured policemen remained unidentified.
Some policemen who had stopped Bhutto's vehicle later claimed that they did not know whose car they had stopped.
"== Police trial ==
On 3 December 2009, a sessions court in Karachi acquitted of murder twenty policemen in the Murtaza Bhutto case pertaining to an armed attack on a police team in which two officials were wounded and a taxi driver was also killed."
"Suddle further said that the police had insisted on checking the vehicles because of tightened security after two bomb blasts in Karachi on Wednesday, 18 September 1996, in which one person was killed and at least four others were wounded."
"The son of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the former Prime Minister of Pakistan, he earned a bachelor's degree from Harvard University and a master's degree from the University of Oxford."
"Anwar, after detailed conversations with Salamullah Tipu, which he recounts in his book tells of the role Najibullah played along with Murtaza in directing the hijack from the Kabul airport control tower."
"Eventually they resorted to taking up arms, their main target being Zia-ul-Haq."
"Mercy appeals were sent by several heads of state to General Zia-ul-Haq; however, all these appeals were disregarded and Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto was executed."
"=== Official explanation ===
A Sindh government handout issued late the night of Bhutto's death said that Bhutto's vehicle was allowed to proceed to his residence by SHO Clifton after it was stopped."
"Tipu had attempted to join the AZO in Kabul, but was rejected as the AZO supposedly never accepted those that came to them (in what was to be a futile effort to prevent infiltration)."
"It was formed in the late seventies by the sons of former Pakistani Prime Minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was also the Chairman of Pakistan's biggest political party, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP)."
"Bhutto submitted his master thesis, containing a vast argumentative work on Nuclear strategic studies, where he advocated for Pakistan's right to develop its nuclear deterrence programme to counter Indian nuclear programme."
The bodies reached JPMC Hospital at about 3:30 a.m.
"He was born in a Satti Rajput Bhutto family, and has three siblings: Benazir, Shahnawaz and Sanam."
Murtaza had been in Pakistan until Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's government was overthrown on 5  July 1977.
"After Benazir's government was dismissed in 1996, Zardari was detained for having a part in Murtaza's assassination."
"== Personal life ==
Bhutto fell in love with a Afghan girl named, Fauzia Fasihuddin Bhutto, in Afghanistan."
He said that Bhutto had exited the car to talk with the official.
"Leaders from Syria, Libya, and the PLO were particularly supportive."
A man was seen struggling for his life after being hit by police fire in front of the DIG police residence.
"After increasing tensions between the two, he was shot dead along with six associates in a police encounter near his home in Karachi on 20 September 1996."
"For a period of time, he was the roommate of Texas gubernatorial candidate and former mayor of Houston, Bill White."
"But on 16 September 1977 when Ali Bhutto was arrested at Al-Murtaza, he asked his son to leave the country."
The helicopter flew up to sea side and then returned and landed at Bagh Ibn-e-Qasim where the youth clinging to the helicopter's skid fell down and the chopper flew away.
"Along with other family members, Murtaza had returned to Al-Murtaza, Larkana, and at the time was busy helping in the preparations for the elections scheduled for October 1977."
"However, he was not happy with the ways of Benazir's husband Asif Ali Zardari and wanted him removed from influence in the PPP."
"However, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto advised his children to leave the country in the shortest time possible."
"He writes that the idea to hijack a plane came from Murtaza Bhutto himself, who was 'obsessed' about the tactic after the Palestinians resorted to it in the seventies and eighties."
Murtaza founded al-Zulfiqar after his father was overthrown and executed in 1979 by the military regime of General Zia-ul-Haq.
It is widely believed in Pakistan that this incident drove Zardari to rage and he used police machinery to assassinate Murtaza Bhutto.
"No anesthetist was available at the hospital, which normally does not treat medico-legal cases."
"He returned to Pakistan in 1993 and was arrested for terrorism on the orders of his sister, then-Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto."
"However, the marriage ended in divorce, and Bhutto along with his daughter moved to Syria, where he married the Lebanese dancer Ghinwa Bhutto in 1989."
Bhutto then collapsed and lost consciousness.
"Murtaza was shot in his collarbone, chest, leg and abdomen."
"During the 13 years that the trial dragged on, a number of judges were appointed to hear the murder case."
"In the book, she indicates that the actual leader of the hijacking was Salamullah Tipu."
"He married Fauzaia in 1980, and his brother Shahnawaz married her sister Rehana Fasihuddin."
"Jatoi was a brother in-law of Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi, the former Prime Minister of Pakistan."
His body refused to accept a blood transfusion while he was being operated upon.
"Raja says that while the hijackers had arrived into Kabul with only revolvers, they were soon furnished with semi-automatic weapons after Murtaza's successive meetings with Tipu under the 'belly of the PIA aircraft'."
"== Death ==
Just before his death, Bhutto, 42, had verbally attacked the government."
"The firing continued for half an hour, causing great panic in the area."
Bhutto was sought by the police on the charge of inciting attacks on two CIA centres the previous Tuesday where it was thought that his party activist Ali Sunara was detained.
Al-Zulfiqar was a leftist insurgency and militant organisation of Pakistan.
"In 1981, he claimed responsibility for the murder of conservative politician Chaudhry Zahoor Elahi, and the hijacking of a Pakistan International Airlines airplane from Karachi, during which a hostage was killed."
"The policemen alleged that security guards, belonging to Bhutto and stationed at his house, opened fire, injuring several policemen."
"Those who were killed with Bhutto were identified as Ashiq Jatoi, Rehman Brohi, Sajjad Hyder, Abdul Sattar Rajpur, Yar Mohammed Baloch and Wajahat Jokhio."
They said that they would not have opened fire on the motorcade had they known that it was Bhutto's.
"""We were returning from a public meeting at Surjani Town, District West of Karachi, when the police and Rangers stopped near the 70 Clifton,"" Dr. Memon stated at the JPMC Casualty Department."
Others said that they had fired in panic and self-defence.
"Among the dead was Aashiq Jatoi, the acting provincial chief of the Pakistan People's Party (Shaheed Bhutto Group)."
Senior police officials were tight-lipped about the tragedy.
Rahim was executed following Murtaza's conferring with Afghan Intelligence (KHAD) chief Mohammad Najibullah.
Hindustan Times.
"They were ordered out of the ICU, where the only official present was the Deputy Commissioner South, Arif Elahi."
Other gunmen sitting in Bhutto's vehicle also started firing straight at the police.
"The policemen who were shot were ASP Saddar Shahid Hayat, SHO Clifton Haq Nawaz Sayyal, and SHO Napier Junaid."
He tried to take off the oxygen mask but the doctors kept replacing it.
"Police returned fire, killing six people, all members of Murtaza Bhutto's faction."
"Police said Bhutto's followers, who were in three cars returning from a party, fired first when asked to stop."
"While the helicopter managed to lift off, many of the visibly moved supporters fell down."
"=== Narrative of the Pakistan People's Party of Shaheed Bhutto ===
Dr. Mazhar Memon, Senior Vice-President of the party's Hyderabad Division, blamed the police for opening fire on Bhutto without any provocation."
"After Ali Bhutto was sentenced, Murtaza joined hands with his brother, Shahnawaz Bhutto, to initiate a campaign to muster international support to revoke the death penalty looming over his father's head."
"Memon added that when the firing died down, the Rangers who were on the spot jumped from their vehicles."
"The pilot of one of the helicopters which carried the body had difficulty in lifting the chopper as a number of supporters of Bhutto from Lyari, Karachi clung to the skids in a bid to board the aircraft."
This was confirmed by the Deputy Inspector General of police Shoaib Suddle.
He later passed his 'O' levels from the Karachi Grammar School in 1971.
"Soon after the incident, when newsmen rushed to the hospital, they were beaten by highly emotionally charged policemen."
"Dr Memon added that when Bhutto's guards saw him on the ground in a pool of blood, they rushed out and opened fire on the police."
Doctors revived his heart once when it stopped but failed to do so the second time.
"The police, under the command of ASP Drakshan and ASP Saddar, returned fire in self-defence, and after an encounter of 20 to 25 minutes, took control of the situation."
"Contrary to this, Raja Anwar in his book The Terrorist Prince paints a negative picture of Murtaza Bhutto."
"From Kabul the journey went on to Damascus, Syria."
"== Rift with Asif Ali Zardari ==
After returning to Pakistan from exile , Bhutto offered his sister, Benazir Bhutto, the chance to revive the manifesto of PPP which his father championed."
Murtaza and Shahnawaz both cut short their respective courses of study and decided to devote themselves to avenge their father's death.
"== Aftermath ==
Sources  said that when Murtaza Bhutto arrived at the Mideast hospital in an official car, blood was oozing from his mouth."
Murtaza Bhutto was supposedly only to hear about the hijacking when Tipu called him in Afghanistan from the hijacked aircraft.
"On Thursday, 20 September 1996 at 6:35 p.m., Bhutto, along with six other party activists, was killed in an encounter with police near his residence in Clifton, Karachi."
"The hijacking went on for thirteen days, during which Murtaza shot Major Tariq Rahim for being an Army officer."
Benazir's government was dismissed a month later by President Farooq Leghari primarily citing Murtaza's death and corruption.
"In 1976, Bhutto graduated with his thesis entitled ""Modicum of Harmony""."
Al-Zulfiqar was formed to avenge the execution of Ali Bhutto by the right-wing military regime of General Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq in 1979.
"At this time Bhutto's wife Ghinva and daughter Fatimah, both of them crying, reached the hospital."
"The party activists who were wounded were identified as Dr. Mazhar Memon, Siraj Hyder, Ismail, Ayaz, Asghar and Bachhal."
Benazir became highly unpopular after this incident and her limo was stoned by PPP workers when she tried to visit Murtaza's funeral ceremonies.
"""Musharraf says Zardari involved in assassination of Benazir, Murtaza Bhutto""."
They had a daughter Fatima Bhutto.
"On Saturday, the body was taken for burial by helicopter to Larkana, Sindh."
The police arrested 12 supporters of Bhutto and seized about a dozen AK-47 rifles from their possession.
"These pleas according to one of the hijackers were delivered to Murtaza Bhutto, who not only discarded them, but instead instructed Salamullah Tipu to execute Tariq Rahim."
The policemen ignored Bhutto and continued firing.
Other reasons include a lack of interest of the prosecution witnesses and long adjournments sought by the counsel for President Asif Ali.
"Bhutto's gunmen, sitting on the land cruiser vehicle, resorted to indiscriminate firing injuring Area Superintendent of Police (ASP) Saddar, SHO Clifton and a person in a nearby taxi."
"Murtaza, along with his siblings, returned to Pakistan immediately."
"""A Strange Encounter With Murtaza Bhutto""."
"While in Europe studying for his PhD studies, his sister, Benazir Bhutto, had notified Murtaza Bhutto about the coup d'état led by General Zia-ul-Haq."
"The most compelling account from 'The Terrorist Prince' tell of the treatment meted out to Major Tariq Rahim, who was ADC to Murtaza's father Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto."
The injured were moved to the Aga Khan Hospital and Civil Hospital.
He served in various ministerial capacities in the 1968–1969 administration of Prime Minister of France Maurice Couve de Murville including Finance Minister.

"Through his final season in 2019, Pelini posted an overall record of 33–28 with one playoff appearance in 2015 during his five-year tenure at Youngstown State."
"Pelini believed that he had built up enough ""points"" for at least partial forgiveness for his statements from the fans."
"After a loss to the UCLA Bruins, Nebraska won their remaining regular season games with the exception of a 38–63 loss to eventual Big Ten Leaders Division champion Ohio State."
The following week and in only his third game returning as LSU defensive coordinator his defense gave up 586 total yards and 45 points in a 45 to 41 loss to Missouri.
"After a loss to the UCLA Bruins, Nebraska lost starting quarterback Taylor Martinez, the first of many injuries during the 2013 season."
"His behavior is consistent with a pattern of unprofessional, disrespectful behavior directed by Mr. Pelini toward the passionate fans of Nebraska, employees of the university and, most concerning, our student-athletes."
Pelini was named the interim head coach and led the Cornhuskers to a 17–3 win over the Michigan State Spartans in the 2003 Alamo Bowl.
"== Playing career ==
Pelini was raised in Youngstown, Ohio, a former center of steel production with a strong athletic tradition."
"Tom Osborne, former coach and athletic director at Nebraska, then announced that he had heard the tape in 2012 (about a year earlier) and talked to Pelini about it but did not tell Perlman about it."
"During this period, he also completed his master’s degree in sports administration from Ohio University in 1992."
"Barney Cotton was announced as interim head coach, and prepared the team for its bowl game."
"Pelini started in his last two years, and served as a team co-captain in his senior year, along with Vinnie Clark, Jeff Graham, and Greg Frey."
Pelini was selected after a nine-day search as the next head coach.
"Nebraska proceeded to beat the Colorado Buffaloes in the final regular game of the season, clinching the Big 12 North title."
"In the 2010 Big 12 Championship Game, Nebraska committed four turnovers and blew a 17–0 second quarter lead on the way to a 23–20 defeat to Big 12 South Co-Champion Oklahoma."
"Then the Huskers traveled to Ames, Iowa and beat a 2–10 Iowa State Cyclones."
"At the conclusion of the regular season, despite posting a 9–3 record, Solich was fired by new Nebraska athletic director Steve Pederson."
Nebraska was defeated by the Wisconsin Badgers in the Cornhuskers' first Big Ten Conference game.
They finished tied for second in the Big Ten's West Division with a 9–3 record and ranked 25th in the nation.
"On December 17, the Omaha World-Herald obtained audio of Pelini attacking Eichorst in vulgar terms while addressing his players on December 2."
"At halftime, the coach snapped at ESPN on ABC reporter Quint Kessenich when asked about a pair of Cornhusker turnovers, responding with ""What kind of question is that?"""
Pelini's 2008 regular season record of 9–4 was the highest among all 28 Division I FBS teams with new head coaches and staffs that year.
We are confident that Coach will conduct himself accordingly moving forward.
"Nebraska finished the season with a 33–0 win over the Arizona Wildcats in the 2009 Holiday Bowl where Pelini proclaimed to the Nebraska fans in the Holiday Bowl stands ""Nebraska is back and we're here to stay!""."
"He was quickly promoted to assistant secondary coach, and by the spring of 1994 he had been promoted again to defensive backs coach."
"Nebraska would go on to lose to the Minnesota Golden Gophers, Michigan State Spartans and Iowa Hawkeyes to finish the regular season 8–4."
Pelini led his team to the 2009 Big 12 Championship Game against the #3 Texas Longhorns.
"Suh flourished under coach Pelini, finishing the 2009 season with 85 tackles, 12 sacks, 24 tackles for a loss, 10 passes broken up, 3 blocked kicks, one interception, and a forced fumble."
"Texas, led by quarterback Colt McCoy, was heavily favored over the Huskers, who were ranked number 21."
I was venting following a series of emotional events which led to this moment.
"The Cornhuskers were ranked in the preseason at #24 by the AP, the first pre-season ranking since the 2007 season."
The week leading up to the game had much of the national focus revolving the firing of coach Joe Paterno and the sexual assault charges in the Penn State sex abuse scandal.
He was most recently the defensive coordinator for the Louisiana State University Tigers football team.
The first road game of the season produced a loss to the Texas Tech Red Raiders in overtime despite giving up 8.77 yards per play.
"The Penguins went 5–6 in 2015 but rebounded in 2016 to go 12–4, losing the FCS Championship game 28-14 to James Madison University."
"Nebraska rebounded by winning three games in a row, including a 21-point second half comeback – the largest in school history – against Ohio State and a 24–3 win versus #9 Michigan State."
"Pelini remained defiant in the post game press conference, referring to his personal foul call as ""chicken shit"" and declaring, ""If they want to fire me, go ahead…I don't apologize for anything I have done."""
We have discussed the report with Coach.
I love it here in Nebraska and feel fortunate to be associated with such a great University and fan base.
We'll see what they can do when I'm fucking gone.
What a bunch of fucking fair-weather fucking—they can all kiss my ass out the fucking door.
"On November 8, Bo Pelini's Nebraska Cornhuskers won against the Kansas Jayhawks, making them bowl eligible."
"Despite the loss in the game, the Big 12 Championship Game showcased the skill of Ndamukong Suh."
"The University is contracted to pay Pelini $7.65 million in salary following his termination in the form of $150,000 monthly payments for the next 51 months."
After that winning streak they were upset by the unranked Northwestern Wildcats where they suffered two fumbles inside the Northwestern 30 yard line.
Some observers and members of the media believed that Pelini would have a difficult time winning back fan support.
"Nebraska finished the 2013 season with a 9–4 record, Pelini's sixth straight season with nine or more wins."
"Nebraska then proceeded to lose a close game to Virginia Tech Hokies, and then suffered the worst home loss in school history to the Missouri Tigers 52–17 the next week."
"That being said, these comments are in no way indicative of my true feelings."
"With his performance Suh was invited to the 2009 Heisman Trophy ceremony, where he finished 4th."
"Pelini left the NU football program with a 67–27 record, winning at least 9 games in every season."
The Cornhuskers won the game 17–14.
"In 2002, the season prior to his hiring, Cornhuskers' defense was ranked 55th nationally."
"Pelini's Huskers then lost on the road the following week to the Oklahoma Sooners by a tune of 62–28, where Oklahoma scored 35 straight before Nebraska answered."
"Following disappointing losses to both the Texas Longhorns and Texas A&M Aggies, the Cornhuskers dropped to #15 in the AP poll going into the final week of the regular season therefore eliminating any realistic hopes of a national championship in 2010."
In his first three games returning as the LSU defensive coordinator the LSU defense surrendered a school record 96 combined points.
I didn't really have any relationship with the AD.
"=== Nebraska Cornhuskers (DC/Int. HC) ===
Pelini returned to the college ranks in 2003 when he was hired as Defensive Coordinator for the Nebraska Cornhuskers by Head Coach Frank Solich."
Faux created a fake Christmas Card which prominently featured Pelini holding a cat.
"Suh won almost every major post season award available to a defensive lineman, including the Lombardi Award, Outland Trophy, Chuck Bednarik Award, Bronko Nagurski Trophy, and The Bill Willis Trophy."
It really wasn't.
Pelini served as head coach of the Nebraska Cornhuskers from December 2007 until November 2014 and later served as head coach of the Youngstown State University football team from 2015 through 2019.
The total liquidation to be paid to Pelini is roughly $7.9 million.
Nebraska was expecting big seasons from running back Roy Helu and defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh.
"Eichorst stated at a press conference that Pelini hadn't won ""the games that mattered the most"" against top-tier opponents."
"His success continued, as LSU was ranked 3rd nationally in overall defense for each of his three years with the Tigers."
"Following the release of the audio tape University of Nebraska–Lincoln chancellor Harvey Perlman stated that the university would consider how to respond to the matter, and subsequently decided to move on from the incident."
A prayer was held before the game for both teams by Nebraska running backs coach Ron Brown.
Leaked audio of the meeting revealed that the coach verbally attacked University of Nebraska administration.
This game marked the first time Pelini went up against Bob Stoops who he formerly worked under as defensive coordinator for the Sooners in 2004.
"After graduating from Youngstown Cardinal Mooney High School (the same high school as Bob Stoops, former head coach of the Oklahoma Sooners), he went on to play free safety for the Buckeyes at Ohio State University under College Football Hall of Fame head coaches Earle Bruce and John Cooper from 1987 to 1990."
The Cornhuskers never led during the game and were defeated by a score of 31–70.
"In 1993, he served for one year as quarterbacks coach at Cardinal Mooney High School in Youngstown."
"Nebraska went on and defeated Georgia 24–19 in the Gator Bowl, avenging last year's bowl loss to the Bulldogs."
"He said he enjoyed his job at Nebraska, had had great support, and had turned down job offers from other schools."
"Firing
On November 30, 2014, after the conclusion of the regular season, Pelini was fired by Nebraska Director of Athletics Shawn Eichorst, effective immediately."
"During the November 14, 2015 game against the North Dakota State Bison in the 4th quarter, Pelini engaged the referees in several heated arguments for penalties they called including two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties on Pelini."
In his first year it improved to 11th and led the country in turnover margin.
"=== Nebraska Cornhuskers (HC) ===
During the 2007 football season, Nebraska Chancellor Harvey Perlman fired athletic director Steve Pederson, and appointed former Cornhuskers head coach Tom Osborne as Interim Athletic Director."
"Pelini questioned Eichorst's integrity, calling him  ""a fucking lawyer who makes policies,"" a ""total pussy"" and a ""total cunt."""
'Cause the day is fucking coming now.
"=== Youngstown State ===
Pelini was hired by Youngstown State in December 2014 as their new head coach."
"Later, in disagreement with a call made on the field, Pelini swung his hat within inches of an official's face, drawing a 15-yard penalty for unsportsmanlike conduct."
The guy — you guys saw him (Sunday) — the guy's a total p----.
This performance was rewarded in March 2009 when his salary was increased from $1.1 to $1.8 million.
They were spoken in a private room following the Ohio State game.
"Before the season even started, Pelini had to kick his second leading rusher, Quentin Castille off the team."
"His habitual use of inappropriate language, and his personal and professional attacks on administrators, are antithetical to the values of our university."
"Nebraska's final rank in the coaches and AP media poll was 14th, the highest final ranking since 2001."
"The All-American had 4.5 sacks to go along with 12 tackles, 7 of them coming behind the line of scrimmage."
Nebraska was expected by several sports analysts to compete for the Big 12 title before departing to the Big Ten Conference in 2011.
"Due to postseason ineligibility of both Ohio State and Penn State, they played the third place team in the Leaders Division, Wisconsin."
"=== LSU Tigers (DC) – Second tenure ===
On Jan. 27, 2020, Pelini was named LSU's next defensive coordinator, replacing Dave Aranda."
"He was nicknamed ""Bo"" after former Cleveland Browns running back Bo Scott."
"The Cornhuskers' 7–1 conference record earned the team their first Big Ten Legends Division title, and first appearance to the 2012 Big Ten Football Championship Game."
"Despite this record, and winning several bowl games, Nebraska never won a conference title under Pelini."
"Despite having to replace record-setting quarterback Joe Ganz, and the entire receiving corps, Nebraska was expected to contend in the wide open Big 12 North Division."
Pelini subsequently apologized for his behavior after the Iowa game.
"Bo Pelini's arrival saw a renewed interest and optimism in Nebraska football, as evidenced by their record Pay-Per View buys."
"By halftime, the score was 49–14."
"The recording was made following Nebraska's come-from-behind win against Ohio State in 2011, when it was reported that some students left when Nebraska was down 27–6 early in the 3rd quarter."
"However the next week against Vanderbilt, the defense only gave up a touchdown."
The Huskers won 34–27.
"One day after the Cornhuskers' final game of the season, a 65–51 loss to the Colorado Buffaloes and finishing the season with 5 wins and 7 losses, Osborne fired Bill Callahan and announced an immediate search for a new football coach."
"2014 Spring Game
Pelini embraced his alter ego twitter account, Faux Pelini, during the Tunnel Walk for the 2014 Spring Game."
They came back home and won against the Baylor Bears.
"The victory was the first bowl shutout of Nebraska's 45 bowl history, as well as the first shutout in Holiday Bowl history."
"Pelini interviewed for the Nebraska head coach position, but Pederson instead decided after a 41-day search to hire Bill Callahan, recently head coach of the Oakland Raiders."
"=== Second audiotape leak ===
Following his firing on November 30, 2014 Pelini met with his (former) team at a local high school on December 2."
"I mean, he is."
"The Cornhuskers came out strong tying it up at 14–14 with four minutes to go in the 2nd quarter, but Wisconsin's offense dominated Nebraska in the 2nd half and ending up winning the game with a score of 48–17."
The next game for the Cornhuskers came against #12 Penn State.

"Drummerworld (Mostly the same as Yanow's, but with pictures and birthdate)"
Tough struggled with epilepsy throughout his life.
In many instances it was considered a mental deficency.
"He was shot by Carlo Gaetano Orlando, alias Tanino 'e Bastimento, a small-time criminal in Esposito's entourage and a cousin of the Gaetano Nuvoletta."
The competition was stiff and resulted in a number of armed conflicts with rival crews.
"Although his criminal activities slowed down under the influence of his young wife, he sought to regain his lost prestige and activities."
"He was a real guappo, a tall and strong man with a robust physique."
"An imposing criminal with great charisma, he used this advantage and became a kind of lawgiver in his area."
The whole town of Palma Campania turned out to wish them well.
"On 27 April 1955, he married Assunta Maresca, known as Pupetta (Little Doll), a former beauty queen."
"Subsequently, he entered the lucrative control over the fruit and vegetable business in Naples."
"When they met Esposito, she reached into her handbag and pulled out a Smith & Wesson .38."
"Holding it with both hands (""I was afraid I would miss,"" she explained later), she opened fire and killed Esposito in broad daylight."
"== Death ==
On 16 July 1955, at age 29, Simonetti was murdered in broad day light in the Piazza Mercato, the busy market place of Naples."
Simonetti became one of the emerging bosses of the Camorra.
When the Allies left in 1946 that supply disappeared and the government was forced to ration cigarettes.
The killing and the following trial made international headlines.
Farmers who did not accept the conditions would be threatened or their farm would go up in flames.
"However, the increasing post-war demand for cigarettes could not be satisfied by the state industry."
"Some of the more ambitious ones, like Simonetti and Maisto, became more involved."
"The wedding was like a fairy tale with 500 guests, a lot of food and even his rivals Maisto and Esposito."
"They imposed themselves as the protectors of the peasant farmers and shopkeepers, demanding in exchange the right to fix the price of products and control the business."
Some of his fellow citizens turned to him to ask for justice.
In the early 1950s the Camorra controlled the entire chain of the fruit and vegetable markets.
"On 14 October 1955, she was arrested."
Weak modern market structures were regulated by violent mediators who imposed their own business rules.
"She believed the police knew who the man behind the attack was, but were not prepared to do anything about it."
Orlando was sentenced to 30 years.
"The vast supplies of American and British troops stationed in Naples provided for a black market of popular American cigarettes, the americane or bionde (blondes)."
A typical episode was the intimidation of a man who had made his girlfriend pregnant and then left her.
His criminal career started in the 1940s falsifying ration books for food which he then sold on the black market.
The six months pregnant Pupetta was devastated.
"He became a partner of Antonio Esposito, known as Totonno 'e Pomigliano, a Camorra boss from Pomigliano d'Arco."
"Soon a thriving trade smuggling cigarettes from Marseille, Gibraltar, Nice and Tangiers by highly organised and structured foreign criminal groups (the Marseillais, Corsicans, Sicilians) developed, employing local guappi to distribute the cigarettes."
"Simonetti asked the young man, if he preferred spending ten thousand lire in flowers on his marriage or his funeral."
"He had promised to keep a percentage of the profits for Simonetti, but he did not keep his promise."
Many gave them the traditional envelopes stuffed with money.
The trial began in April 1959 at the Court of Assizes in Naples.
"It was very complicated, if not impossible, to collect sufficient evidence to prove the criminal aspect of this business."
"On 4 August 1955, she drove to Naples with her younger brother, Ciro."
"== Early life and career ==
Born in a poor family in Palma Campania, a town located at the foot of the Vesuvius in the hinterland of Naples about 25 km east of the city, Simonetti's father was a carter and his mother was a housewife."
"In 1974, he was abducted and murdered."
"While in prison, his partner Antonio Esposito had taken over his businesses."
"She was sentenced to 18 years’ imprisonment, later reduced to 13 years and 4 months by the Court of Appeal."
To a certain extent he was an alternative to the State authorities which were barely present.
"== Cigarette smuggling ==
After World War II the Italian government reintroduced a state monopoly on tobacco."
Simonetti’s son Pasqualino was born in prison.
"Bigger companies like Cirio, a large tinned tomatoes company in Campania, also fell victim to these practices."
"During his club career he played for Thor Waterschei, Antwerp FC, Helmond Sport, Espanyol Barcelona, KV Mechelen and SV Bornem."
"At international level, he also earned 10 caps for the Belgium national football team, and participated in the 1982 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 1980."
"=== Northern Ireland U21 ===
On 26 July 2021, Schofield became the new manager of Northern Ireland under-21 team."
"He had been signed to provide cover for player-manager Warren Joyce, but fell out with Joyce and found himself out of the team in favour of emerging talent Adam Bolder; he was identified as surplus to requirements by new manager Brian Little in April."
The departure of Keith Alexander as Lincoln's manager on 24 May 2006 saw Schofield take over as caretaker manager.
In the semi-final Lincoln were beaten 7–4 on aggregate by Bristol Rovers.
"Although Allen steered the club clear of relegation at the end of the 2010–11 season, he was sacked on 18 February 2012 with the club occupying 11th-place in League One."
"As a teenager, he had spent a season with Huddersfield Town's reserve team before joining Northern Counties East League side Woolley Miners Welfare."
"He played 34 games in the 1989–90 campaign, scoring two goals, having lost his first-team place in January."
The poor form exhibited by Lincoln in the second half of the 2006–07 season continued into 2007–08 and this was met with increasing unease by the Lincoln supporters with a feeling that Schofield has neglected the defence of the squad in favour of his attacking strategy.
"Following on from his retirement, Schofield held various coaching roles back with Lincoln City, where he eventually became manager and led the club to the League Two play-offs during the 2006–07 season."

He was named as Lincoln City's Player of the Year in 1994.
"He appeared 46 times in the 1990–91 season, scoring three goals, with all his starts coming in the number seven shirt."
"Prior to this he had spells in non-League with Woolley Miners Welfare, Shepshed Charterhouse, Matlock Town and Gainsborough Trinity."
"He trained the first-team in the summer of 2019, before Darren Moore was appointed to the vacant manager role."
"Two days later, following the appointment of Keith Curle as manager, Schofield also departed Meadow Lane."
Schofield was appointed manager on a caretaker basis after Mullen was sacked on 10 January 2009.
"Schofield was placed in caretaker charge, before Peter Taylor was appointed interim manager a day later."
He signed a new two-year deal with the club in April 2006.
"Schofield quickly established himself in the Lincoln team, making 31 appearances in the number 4 shirt in the 1988–89 season."
His spell as caretaker manager had consisted of nine matches with just a single victory: a 5–1 defeat of Barnet.
"The appointment was made full-time on 14 May, when Schofield agreed a two-year contract."
He was named as League Two Manager of the Month for October after winning all four games that month.
"On 17 June 2008, he was appointed first-team coach at Walsall, to work under manager Jimmy Mullen."

"On 8 October, Schofield and Wilcox were sacked by Scunthorpe, after the team started the 2014–15 season with two wins from eleven matches."
"On 7 September 2016, Schofield returned to former club Doncaster Rovers as a Senior Professional Development Coach, working with youth players and younger first-team players to bridge the gap between the squads."
"He featured 50 times in the 1997–98 campaign and 48 times in the 1998–99 season, wearing the number seven shirt throughout his time at Field Mill."
"He featured 27 times as a number eight in the 1994–95 season, before scoring four goals in 46 matches playing as a number seven in the 1995–96 campaign."
"With York 21st in the table after a nine-match run without a win early in the 2015–16 season, Wilcox and Schofield were sacked on 26 October."
He scored his first goal at Sincil Bank in a 4–3 victory over Wrexham on 14 January 1989.
"He played 48 games in the 1992–93 campaign, with Lincoln now in the Third Division due to the creation of the Premier League; he again wore the number seven shirt, aside from a period in mid-season where he was restricted to appearances from the substitutes' bench."
"A hard-working and combative midfielder, he began his career in non-League football, combining this with his job as an apprentice-trained motor mechanic."
"Although Allen was subsequently cleared by an internal club investigation, on 11 December he left the club by mutual consent with Schofield remaining in temporary charge."
He scored three goals in sixteen matches at the start of the 1994–95 season.
"He played 35 games in the 1999–2000 season, beginning the campaign in the starting eleven before being reduced to the role of substitute in the new year."
"However, Lincoln's form fell away in 2007 and rather than pushing for automatic promotion they were, for the fifth season running, forced to settle for a place in the play-offs."
"On 6 July 2010, he joined Cambridge United on a trial basis to assist manager Martin Ling with the club's pre-season preparations."
"As a player he was a midfielder and spent twelve seasons in the basement division of the Football League with Lincoln City, Doncaster Rovers, Mansfield Town and Hull City, making a total of 547 league and cup appearances after turning professional at the age of 23."
"Having impressed, he joined the club on a two-year contract to become first-team coach."
"He took charge for just one match, a 1–0 defeat away to Peterborough United, but left the club ten days later ahead of the appointment of manager Chris Hutchings, who brought in his own right-hand man in former Walsall player Martin O'Connor."
"On 11 April 2011, Notts County appointed Martin Allen as manager on a one-year rolling contract and he quickly appointed Schofield as first-team coach."

Schofield made his debut in a 4–1 win over Fourth Division leaders Burnley at Turf Moor.
"A number of promising players, such as Lee Frecklington, either making the first team squad or being sold to higher-level clubs such as Jack Hobbs who was sold to Liverpool and Scott Loach who moved on to Watford."
His good work was rewarded with an increasing role with the first-team and he was appointed first-team coach prior to the start of the 2005–06 season.
"=== Backroom staff roles ===
Schofield began coaching at Scunthorpe United in February 2008, where he helped carried out extra training sessions for players not involved in the first-team, before he departed at the end of the 2007–08 season."

"In that same year, Li also became the editor of the Common People’s Weekly Magazine, and the next year became an editor at the China Book Bureau, and the following year was promoted to be the principal of the National Language Institute in Shanghai."
Li was devastated by the loss of his daughter and wife.
"Also in 1922, Li began editing the children's magazine Little Friend, which soon became the nation's best selling periodical."
"As radio became more widely accessible, so then did Li's jazz, for which he received vicious criticism as “Yellow (or pornographic) Music.”"
"== Legacy ==
Though a controversial figure in his time, Li Jinhui contributed hundreds of songs to the musical community released by many major recording companies, including Great China, Pathe-EMI and RCA-Victor."
"Instead Li focused on the folk songs, which were considered to be “vulgar” and common."

The style would have some western influence and it moved Chinese music to a new direction.
"During his teenage years, he became fascinated with Chinese folk music, which he later incorporated into his revolutionary new musical style."
"He wrote several satirical political songs for a Changsha newspaper, but one such song so angered a local warlord that Li received a beating for it."

"== Removing the Gang of Four ==
Mao died on 9 September 1976 and Hua, as both the number two-man of the CCP and Premier, led the national commemorations in Beijing in his honor in the days that followed, and was the keynote speaker during the national memorial observance in the capital's Tiananmen Square."
Hua's encouraged a local economy policy that included both planned elements and limited market freedom of the sort that Mao had previously derided as economism.
"Between December 1978 and June 1981, a group of party veterans led by Deng Xiaoping, forced Hua from his position of paramount leader but allowed him to retain some titles."
"Hua moved with the victorious PLA to Hunan in 1948, where he married Han Zhijun, and would remain in that province until 1971."
"Their second son, Su Bin, is a retired army officer."
"When Mao visited the site, in June 1959, he was favorably impressed."
"Hua knew that in the post-Mao power vacuum, his position vis-a-vis the Gang of Four's would be a zero-sum game."
All schools were required to hang Hua's picture next to Mao's.
"Although Mao Zedong had reportedly wanted to appoint Zhang Chunqiao as Zhou Enlai's successor, he ended up naming Hua as acting Premier."
"Weber argues that ""Paying tribute to Mao in the year after his passing was hardly unique to Hua"" and that the Two Whatevers slogan was also upheld by Chen Yun, who along with Deng Xiaoping superseded Hua."
"Hua Guofeng continued to use the terminology of the Cultural Revolution, but he criticized certain aspects of it, including the education reform, the revolutionary committees' activity and other excesses, blaming the Gang of Four."
They were arrested while walking into the meeting at Huairen Hall.
"Hua had summoned Zhang Chunqiao, Wang Hongwen, and Yao Wenyuan to a meeting at Zhongnanhai, ostensibly to discuss the fifth volume of Mao's ""Selected Works""."
"Later that year, he was appointed as the most junior of the seven-member committee investigating the Lin Biao Affair, a sign of the strong trust Mao had in him."
"Afterwards Hua took on the titles of Party Chairman and Chairman of the Central Military Commission, being thus far the only leader to have simultaneously held the offices of party leader, premier and CMC chairman."
Hua's economic and political programs involved the restoration of Soviet-style industrial planning and party control similar to that followed by China before the Great Leap Forward.
He traveled to West Germany and France.
"Vehicles were burned, offices ransacked and there were reports of many injuries and deaths."
"On 6 October 1976, shortly after the death of Mao on 9 September, Hua removed the Gang of Four from political power by arranging for their arrests in Zhongnanhai, with the assistance of Mao's loyal security chief Wang Dongxing, who became one of Hua's strongest supporters, along with Vice Premier and chief economic planner Li Xiannian and Luo Qingchang, head of the intelligence services."
"Hua said that they had engaged in ""anti-party and anti-socialist"" acts and ""conspired to usurp power""."
"Another group was dispatched to stabilize Shanghai, the Gang's main regional power base."
"After 16th Party Congress in November 2002, Hua officially lost his seat on the Central Committee of the CCP."
"A cause of death was not given, and because his death occurred during the festive Beijing Olympics, it was not given much attention by state media: merely a 30-second broadcast on the national news program Xinwen Lianbo and a short paragraph on the corner of the front page of the People's Daily."
"In 1948, as the Communists gained the upper hand in the civil war, Hua was one among 50,000 party officials transferred from North to South China to take control of newly conquered territories and was assigned to Hunan, becoming Party Secretary of Xiangtan, which included Mao's birthplace of Shaoshan."
Hua removed the controls that the Gang of Four had established over cultural and educational policy.
"== Family ==
Hua married Han Zhijun in January 1949."
"During the Tiananmen Incident of 1976, thousands of people protested at the militia's removal of wreaths honoring Zhou in front of the Monument to the People's Heroes."
Hua was appointed as Vice Premier in January 1975.
The ousting of Hua was significant in at least two respects.
"In the aftermath, Deng Xiaoping was blamed for inciting the protests and stripped of all his party and government posts, though his party membership was retained at Mao's behest."
"They had four children, all of whom are surnamed ""Su"" (苏), in accordance with Hua's birth name."
"He ""combined  Soviet-style big push industrialization with an opening up to the capitalist world"" and under his leadership, China opened its first Special Economic Zone and launched major efforts to attract foreign direct investment."
"In February 1978, the party met to approve a new state constitution, which Hua was heavily involved in drafting."
Jiang Qing and Mao Yuanxin were arrested at their respective residences.
"In this role, he built a memorial hall dedicated to Mao."
"A week after reading the late premier's eulogy, Deng left Beijing along with several close allies for the relative safety of Guangzhou."
"He was appointed Party Secretary for Xiangyin County in August 1949, just before the establishment of the People's Republic of China in October of that year."
"It was reported that he voluntarily retired for age and health reasons, but the party did not officially confirm this."
"This struggle was decisively resolved in Deng's favor in December 1978, which is generally taken as the start of the era of Chinese economic reform."
"Hua made national economic development a matter of the highest priority and emphasized the need to achieve ""liberation of productive forces."""
"Hua Guofeng (; born Su Zhu; 16 February 1921 – 20 August 2008), alternatively spelled as Hua Kuo-feng, was a Chinese politician who served as Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party and Premier of the People's Republic of China."
"Despite his retention of formal party positions, Hua distanced himself from active participation in politics."
He died in Beijing on 20 August 2008.
"The members of the Gang were arrested on 6 October, soon after midnight."
"He studied at the Jiaocheng County Commercial School and joined the CCP in 1938, during the Second Sino–Japanese War."
"He organized the preparation for the establishment of the local Revolutionary Committee in 1967, of which he was a Deputy Chairman."
"Born and raised in Jiaocheng, Hua was educated at the Jiaocheng County Commercial School and joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 1938, seeing action in both the Second Sino–Japanese War and the Chinese Civil War as a guerrilla fighter."
"In 1978 all party meetings were to hang portraits of Mao and Hua side-by-side, including at the National People's Congress and CCP Party Congress meetings."
"In October 1979, Hua went on a European tour, the first of its kind for a Chinese leader after 1949."
"Like many Communists of the era who took on revolutionary names, he changed his name to Huá Guófēng as an abbreviation of ""中華抗日救國先鋒隊"" (Zhōnghuá kàngrì jiùguó xiānfēng duì; 'Chinese Anti-Japanese Aggression National Salvation Vanguard')."
"A popular local administrator, Hua rose to become Party Secretary of Hunan during the Cultural Revolution, and was elevated to the national stage in the early 1970s, notably assuming control of the Ministry of Public Security in October 1973."
"His main hobby was grape cultivation, and he kept up with current affairs by subscribing to a host of newspapers."
"Zhou Enlai died on 8 January 1976, at a time when Deng Xiaoping's reformist alliance was not yet strong enough to stand up to both the ailing Mao Zedong and his Cultural Revolution allies, the Gang of Four (Jiang Qing, Zhang Chunqiao, Wang Hongwen, and Yao Wenyuan)."
"As early as January 1979, state media had stopped referring to him as ""the wise leader"" and he was replaced as Premier by Zhao Ziyang in 1980, was replaced as Party Chairman by Hu Yaobang and was replaced as chairman of the Central Military Commission by Deng himself in 1981."
"Following the incarceration of the Gang of Four and the establishment of the new ruling triumvirate (Hua Guofeng, Marshal Ye Jianying, and chief economic planner Li Xiannian) began the restoration to power of Deng Xiaoping and the elimination of Gang influence throughout the political system."
"Hua's influence increased with the Cultural Revolution, as he supported it and led the movement in Hunan."
"First, it demonstrated the unimportance of official titles in the Chinese Communist Party during the late 1970s and early 1980s."
"In 1973, Mao named Hua Minister of Public Security and Vice Premier, thus giving him control of police and security forces."
"That is, if the Gang of Four were not removed through use of force, the Gang might attempt to oust him pre-emptively."
"Despite being the official leader of the party, the state, and the army, Hua was unable to defeat a leadership challenge by Deng Xiaoping."
"Ye had grown disillusioned with the Gang before Mao's death, so he and Hua came to a quick agreement to act  against the Gang."
"== Legacy ==
Hua's legacy is often reduced to the Two Whatevers: ""uphold whatever policy decisions Chairman Mao made, and unswervingly follow whatever instructions Chairman Mao gave."
"Hua reversed some of the Cultural Revolution-era policies, such as the constant ideological campaigns, but he was fully devoted to a centrally planned economy and the continuation of the Maoist line."
"Hua also changed the Chinese national anthem to incorporate Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, switching the tone from being war-rallying to purely Communist ideology."
On 28 October Hua visited the United Kingdom and met with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
"In 1952, he was appointed secretary of Xiangtan Special District, which included Mao's hometown, Shaoshan."
Both Zhao and Hu were protégés of Deng who were dedicated to Chinese economic reform.
"Hua's health deteriorated in 2008, and he was hospitalized for kidney and heart complications."
"Their older daughter, Su Ling, is a party and union official at the Civil Aviation Administration of China."
These lyrics were eventually rejected.
The relaxation of controls over cultural content resulted in a transition from revolutionary art to more individualist and market-oriented works like scar literature.
"Hua's rising influence was confirmed by his being chosen to deliver a speech on modernizing agriculture in October of that year, which echoed the views of Zhou Enlai."
"He was, however, invited to the 17th Party Congress in 2007 as a special delegate and he appeared at a ceremony which was held in December 2007 in order to commemorate the 115th anniversary of Mao Zedong's birth."
"The group discussed ways to remove the Gang, including holding a Politburo or Central Committee meeting to oust them through established party procedure, but the idea was shot down because the Central Committee was, at the time, composed of many of the Gang's supporters."
"Popular affection for Zhou was underestimated, however, leading to the Tiananmen Incident, a confrontation between the radicals' militia allies and Beijing citizens seeking to honor Zhou during the traditional Qingming festival."
"Their first son, Su Hua, is a retired Air Force officer."
"This document, which attempted to restore some rule of law and planning mechanisms from the PRC's original 1956 constitution, still contained references to continuous revolution and proletarian internationalism; it was replaced only four years later with a different constitution."
Hua also attempted reforming state protocol as a method of elevating his prestige.
"""Economic historian Isabella Weber argues that the Hua's upholding of the Two Whatevers policy is an overemphasized aspect of Hua's legacy."
"Hua regained the loyalty of party cadre and intellectuals, who had generally been marginalized during the Cultural Revolution."
"According to Hua's own recollection of events, he and Marshal Ye Jianying were the only two leaders present at the ""meeting"", awaiting the arrival of the members of the Gang."
"Upon the arrest of each of the three, Hua personally announced to them the reasons for their detention."
Chairman Hua visited Derby's British Rail Railway Technical Centre to observe the development of the Advanced Passenger Train.
"At the same time, the media controlled by the Gang of Four began denouncing Deng once again (he had been purged during the Cultural Revolution, and was only returned to power in 1973)."
Hua made contact with Ye days after Mao's death to discuss plans about the Gang of Four.
"The first bibliographical indication of Antonietta Brandeis dates from her teens, when she is mentioned as a pupil of the Czech artist Karel Javůrek of Prague."
She was represented in Venice at the photographer Naya’s studios in Piazza San Marco and in Campo San Maurizio and in Florence she collaborated with the picture dealer Giovanni Masini.
In November 1877 Brandeis showed the large painting Palazzo Cavalli a Venezia at the exhibition of the Hungarian Fine Arts Society in Budapest.
"In the exhibit of 1875 her landscape Palazzo, Marin Falier is sold to M. Hall of London for 320 lire, a first indication of the success Brandeis will achieve with foreign collectors of her work (particularly the English and German visitors to Italy on the Grand Tour circuit)."
"== Teachers ==
Brandeis’s professors at  the Venetian Academy of Fine Arts include Michelangelo Grigoletti and Napoleone Nani for life drawing, Domenico Bresolin for landscape, Pompeo Marino Molmenti for painting and Federico Moja for perspective."
"As well as in Venice and Florence, she exhibited in Turin, Milan, and Rome."
Two are visible in the parish church of Smokvici and of in the church of St. Vitus in Blato.
"”During the years 1878 to 1893 Brandeis painted and exhibited numerous works, primarily scenes of Venice, and although she resided chiefly in that city she also traveled and painted in Verona, Bologna, Florence, and Rome."
"Show curated by Paolo Serafini, also author of the catalogue."
"On October 27th 1897 at the age of 49, Brandeis married the Venetian Antonio Zamboni, a knight and officer of  the Italian Crown and knight of the Order of SS."
"Laura Capella, daughter of her dear friend and fellow artist Giulia Capella, painted the portrait of Brandeis in 1924 which hangs in the Benefactors Room of the Innocenti Institute."
"She is documented as having exhibited eight paintings during the years 1872 to 1876 with the Società Veneta Promotrice di Belle Arti, both landscapes and genre scenes."
Several of these altarpieces can be found on the Island of Korcula in Croatia.
"During these same years, she showed two paintings in the Florentine exhibit Promotrice Fiorentina."
"At this time, Brandeis would have been nineteen, and one of the first females to receive academic instruction in the fine arts in Italy."
Already during her first years of study there is evidence of Brandeis' skill-in her first year she is awarded prizes and honors in Perspective and Life Drawing.
13–21 February 2010 Antonietta Brandeis (1848-1926)Vedute dell’Ottocento al femminile.
"Brandeis was a prolific painter, and often replicated her most popular subjects with only slight variations."
"During this period of intense activity painting landscapes en plein air and genre scenes, Brandeis also is documented in De Gubernatis as a painter of religious altarpieces."
"The couple continued to reside in Venice and Brandeis continued to show at Italian exhibitions in Venice, Florence, and Rome although more sporadically and with fewer works than before."
"As well as at the Innocenti Institute and the Gallery of Modern Art at the Pitti Palace in Florence, Antonietta Brandeis’ works are in private collections in many parts of the world."
"== Exhibitions ==
July 2012 to 28 October 2012, Florence Through the Artists’ Eyes, From Signorini to Rosai, exhibit at the Pitti Palace Exhibit, Gallery of Modern Art, 7th “The Niobe Room at the Uffizi” by Antonietta Brandeis."
"The two paintings remained unsold and were presented at the same exhibition the following year, together with two more genre scene paintings."
"One of four paintings donated to the Pitti Palace by the artist at her death in 1926, this small oil on cardboard (29 x 35 cm.) depicts a female artist engaged in painting from life in the Room of the Niobe, one of the most famous rooms of the Uffizi Gallery."
"In both Florence and Budapest, Brandeis showed her work under the name “Antonio Brandeis”."
"In the 1867 registry of the Venetian Academy of Fine Arts, Brandeis is listed as being enrolled as an art student."
"The biographer De Gubernatis offers the following explanation for the change of name: “her first pictures received praise and criticism; she took the criticism, but when she was praised as a woman she was annoyed, and therefore exhibited under the name Antonio Brandeis."
"In 1870, while still a student at the Academy, she participated in her first exhibition; that of the Società Veneta Promotrice di Belle Arti with the oil painting Cascina della Madonna di Monte Varese."
"In 1876 and 1877 she exhibited three landscapes of Venice at the Promotrice Veneta, which sold to foreign collectors."
"The painting is an extremely faithful depiction of the arrangement of the room at the time, as evidenced by a period photograph in the archives of the City of Florence."
In the sacristy of the Cathedral of Korcula is a Madonna with Christ Child painted by Brandeis.
"Dipinti di una collezione privata, Modenantiquaria  Exhibit of ninety-eight works of Antonietta Brandeis, the first extensive show of this artists’ works."

John Troesser (January 2001).
"There is no contemporaneous evidence to back claims that Longley murdered a black militiaman in Old Evergreen in 1866 for insulting his father, or that he shot eight black people in Lexington in 1867 to avenge the loss of a horse racing bet."
"The murder was alleged to have been instigated by Longley's uncle, Caleb B. Longley, who had blamed Anderson for the death of his son, Cale, and urged Longley to take revenge."
"== Return to Texas and further murders ==
Longley's travels for the rest of 1872 are unknown, but by February 1873 he had returned to Texas, where he was accused of murdering another freedman in Bastrop County."

Many of these legends trace back to tall tales that Longley himself told while imprisoned in Giddings in 1877.
"By 1867, Texas was fully under the control of the Union due to the Reconstruction Act."
"Some of these stories are probably false, while others could be true but lack any contemporary corroborating evidence."

"Additionally, Horák was selected by the Western Hockey League's (WHL) Chilliwack Bruins with the eighth overall pick in the Canadian Hockey League (CHL) import draft."
He improved to 26 goals and 78 points in 2010–11.
He scored his first NHL goal on October 26 against Jean-Sébastien Giguère of the Colorado Avalanche.
"He returned to the team for the 2011 tournament, recording one assist in five games in that tournament."
"In his first season in Chilliwack, Horák scored 21 goals and 47 points."
"Initially expected to join the Flames' minor league affiliate, the Abbotsford Heat of the American Hockey League (AHL), to begin the 2011–12 season, Horák exceeded the team's expectations and earned a spot with the Flames."
"He was selected by the New York Rangers in the fifth round, 127th overall, of the 2009 NHL Entry Draft, and joined the Calgary Flames organization via trade in 2011."
"The Flames discovered Horák while scouting his teammate, and their own draft pick, Ryan Howse."

"Additionally, he represented the Czech Republic at the 2010 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, where he had one goal and one assist in six games."
"Voldemaras and his wife escaped unharmed, but his nephew was seriously hurt."
It later emerged that he died while in Moscow Butyrka prison on 16 December 1942.
"In 1918, he represented the Lithuanian interests at the peace negotiations for the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk between Germany and the Soviet Russia."
His academic works were highly acclaimed and in 1923-1924 he participated in international scientific congresses on History and Sociology.
"He briefly served as the country's first prime minister in 1918 and continued serving as the minister of foreign affairs until 1920, representing the fledgling Lithuanian state at the Versailles Peace Conference and the League of Nations."
"In absentia, he was replaced as the Prime Minister on 26 December 1918 by Mykolas Sleževičius."
"At the university, he served as a professor and the dean of sociological studies."
One of the many problems facing the council was the lack of unity among Lithuanian organizations — several were claiming to represent Lithuania on the international stage.
"Voldemaras's first stated priority was to ensure the internal stability of the country, hoping that a statement of neutrality would be enough to deter foreign interference for a time."
"Voldemaras again assumed the role of the minister of foreign affairs together with that of prime minister, seeing foreign relations as the key issue for the government."
"The stated purpose of the trip was to secure a badly needed loan from Germany and to participate in the Versailles Peace Conference, but the departure generated outrage in Lithuania where Voldemaras was seen as fleeing the Soviet advance."
"The move prompted the Christian Democrats to leave the government, leaving the Nationalist Union as the sole governing party."
"In 1918, Voldemaras finally returned to Lithuania and was invited to join the Council of Lithuania after several members had left the council in protest of its alignment with Germany."
"Voldemaras's political opponents, the Christian Democrats, alleged in Lithuanian press that the couple were living together outside marriage, but the issue was not pressed by the Holy See and the couple received blessings from the Pope."
Smetona installed his brother-in-law Juozas Tūbelis as the Prime Minister.
"His personality and oratory skills attracted adherents among the younger nationalist officers, who were favorably impressed by the emerging fascism, and who were displeased with what they perceived as Smetona's more moderate course."
"As early as the beginning of 1929, Smetona was preparing to oust Voldemaras from the government."
"In 1919, Voldemaras met Matilda Voldemarienė (née Delahay)."
"Voldemaras, together with President Smetona, left Lithuania on 21 December 1918."
"At least seven shots were fired, killing Voldemaras's adjutant and injuring several others."
Their ideology and practices (initiates would kiss an iron dagger as part of their initiation ceremony) were outside the comfort zone of many among the populace and the political elite.
"The coup took place on 17 December, deposing Grinius and installing Smetona as the president for a second time and Voldemaras as the prime minister."
"Ostensibly a youth sport organization and registered as such in 1928, Iron Wolf was heavily nationalistic and had a stated purpose of combating the enemies of the state."
"In 1929, the couple acted as the godparents to the three-year-old Valdas Adamkus, who would later become the President of Lithuania."
"To assuage public opinion, in both Lithuania and the outside world, Grinius agreed to appoint Voldemaras as the Prime Minister, on a condition that the latter would uphold the constitution of 1922."
In 1890 he moved to Saint Petersburg to join his brother who had been working there.
"Voldemaras and his colleagues found little support for their goals among the great powers: those supporting a strong Russia saw Lithuania as an integral part of that state, while the proponents of Poland as a bulwark against bolshevism thought Lithuanian independence would weaken it."
"In 1926, Voldemaras was elected to the Seimas and was particularly critical of the President Kazys Grinius and his government that came to power after the elections of 1926."
"Though born to a family of modest means and education, Augustinas excelled at his studies."
"Voldemaras joined the activities of the newly established Party of National Progress in 1916 and joined one of the Lithuanian student groups in Saint Petersburg, representing it at the Petrograd Seimas in June 1917 and the Congress of Non-Sovereign Nations in Kiev in September 1917."
"While preparing for the exams in 1901, Voldemaras met Antanas Smetona who would become his close friend, political collaborator and, eventually, his political nemesis."
1926-27 saw the establishment of Geležinis Vilkas (Iron Wolf) organization among right-wing army officers and students.
"Since Lithuania was not part of the negotiations, he was officially part of the delegation of the short-lived Ukrainian People's Republic."
"They appealed to Voldemaras and Antanas Smetona, now the leaders of the Lithuanian Nationalist Union, to support them, both of whom agreed."
"== Later life and death ==
Voldemaras attempted to return to Lithuania in 1939, but was exiled again."
He moved to Perm to become a professor when the Imperial University opened its branch there (the branch would later become Perm State University).
He was arrested at the border and imprisoned.
"After his stint on the government, he returned to academia in 1920, teaching courses and eventually joining the University of Lithuania (now Vytautas Magnus University) in Kaunas."
"In 1926, a segment of the army that disagreed with the policies of Grinius administration planned a military coup d'état."
The wave of nationalism sweeping Lithuania did not elude him and the many other Lithuanians in the Russian Empire — prominent voices started calling for Lithuanian independence or autonomy within the Empire.
"Events moved rapidly after the defeat of Germany in the World War I, with Germany recognizing the Lithuanian independence and its army withdrawing."
"The outpouring of public and international support made it impossible for Smetona to dismiss Voldemaras, but pushed the latter to get even more involved with Geležinis Vilkas."
"Voldemaras was imprisoned for the next four years, receiving amnesty on the condition he would leave the country."
"A brilliant orator, Voldemaras represented the radical wing of the Lithuanian Nationalist Union that was increasingly critical of the more moderate policies of President Smetona."
"Dissatisfied with the left-wing government of President Kazys Grinius, Voldemaras and fellow nationalist Antanas Smetona supported the military coup d'état in December 1926 and he was appointed as the prime minister for a second time."
Augustinas Voldemaras (16 April 1883 – 16 May 1942) was a Lithuanian nationalist political figure.
"While Voldemaras always introduced her as his wife, the status of their relationship was not completely clear and generated some amount of controversy in Lithuania, particularly when the couple visited the Vatican in 1927."
"In 1930, he was exiled to Plateliai and later to Zarasai, where he lived under police surveillance."
Voldemaras was arrested in 1934 after the failed coup against Smetona and served a prison sentence until exiled to France in 1938.
"In January 1928, Voldemaras signed a border treaty with Germany, in which Germany accepted the Lithuanian possession of Klaipėda (Memel)."
"Kondratovich, who was an ethnic Russian and was viewed with suspicion by many, failed to take measures to organize the defense of the country and proposed to move the government to Grodno when Vilnius was threatened by Soviet advance."
"In 1909, Voldemaras graduated in History and Philosophy at the Saint Petersburg Imperial University and, in 1910, received his Master's Degree and was awarded a gold medal for his dissertation."
"On 6 May 1929, as Voldemaras, his wife and their friends were approaching a theater in Kaunas, they were shot on from behind."
Smetona had Voldemaras removed from office in September 1929 and exiled to Zarasai.
"Several officers sympathetic to Voldemaras and associated with Geležinis Vilkas attempted to replace Smetona, but the coup did not have widespread support in the military and was unsuccessful."
"Voldemaras joked at the time that he had promised to hold elections, but made no promises on the year they would be held in."
"Although Voldemaras made this commitment, he and Smetona would renege on it within a year when the Third Seimas was dissolved and no new elections were called."
"In September 1918, Voldemaras, together with Smetona, participated in a conference in Lausanne, Switzerland, helping to unite the organizations behind the Council of Lithuania."
"A polyglot, Voldemaras was familiar with sixteen different languages and wrote academic works in Lithuanian and French."
"Three Lithuanian students, members of Aušrininkai, were accused of involvement in the assassination attempt, with one of them sentenced and executed."
It was from Zarasai that he was flown into Kaunas during an attempted coup against Smetona in June 1934.
"The Lithuanian representatives in Versailles focused on receiving recognition of the independent Lithuania and its borders, as well as securing support in the struggle against Bolsheviks."
"In 1902, Voldemaras passed the exams to enter a gymnasium, eventually graduating with distinction in 1904."
"Although Smetona was the honorary head of the organization, it was Voldemaras who actively participated in managing it."
"In June 1940, days after the Soviet Union invaded and occupied Lithuania, Voldemaras and his wife made another attempt to return from exile."
"In 1923, his political writings earned him a punishment of one month of forced labor in Varniai."
He finished the public school in nearby Tverečius and graduated from a three-year school in Švenčionys.
"On 19 September 1929, while attending a meeting of the League of Nations, Voldemaras was ousted by President Smetona after the cabinet resigned."
These initial plans were revised by an attempt on Voldemaras's life in May.

Bondarenko was pushed to 2.41 by American Eric Kynard.
"=== 2013 outdoor season ===
Bondarenko seems not to have competed on the indoor circuit during the previous years."
That was the highest jump in the world since 1994.
"Less than a week later, in July 2013, Bondarenko cleared 2.41 metres at another Diamond League meet, the Athletissima, in Lausanne, Switzerland."
"He secured the win after just his third jump and then had the bar raised to 2.43 (7' 11 1/2"") – one centimeter above the European record set by Sweden's Patrik Sjöberg in 1987."
When Bohdan won the European Athlete of the Year trophy 2013 his father (and thus trainer) received a trainer's award of the European Athletics Association.
I was able to make only one technical practice one week before my first performance this season.
"Almost incidental, Bondarenko won the competition on fewer misses."
In August 2006 he competed at the 2006 World Junior Championships in Beijing.
[Ukhov and Carlo Thränhardt (1988) have also jumped that height under more controlled conditions indoors.]
"Drouin failed his 3 attempts at 2.41, while Barshim, after his first attempt, saved the remaining two for the following height of 2.44 (which Bondarenko had passed), but couldn't get it, settling for silver."
"When Bondarenko then cleared 2.39 on his first try, Kynard missed and then used his two remaining attempts at 2.41 (unsuccessfully.)"

"He made one excellent attempt and despite knocking the bar off, he felt confident enough to have the bar raised for a world record attempt of 2.47 (8 feet, one and one-quarter inch), threatening the 20-year world record of 2.45 held by Cuba's Javier Sotomayor."
"With a jump of 2.14 metres in the qualifying round, he barely managed to reach the final round, where – at age 16 – he was the youngest finalist."
"He had not recorded a notable result during the indoor season, but with a jump of 2.25 metres he qualified for the 2008 World Junior Championships in Bydgoszcz, leading the season's list for juniors."
"After clearing 2.34m, Bondarenko elected to pass attempts at 2.37 and 2.41, the later which was cleared by Mutaz Essa Barshim."
"Bondarenko uses the Fosbury Flop technique, jumping off his right leg."
"Pre-event favorite Karim Samir Lofty disappointed greatly, ending in last place."
In 2007 he improved his indoor best mark to 2.25 at a meet in Kyiv in February.
Bondarenko then had the bar raised to world record height of 2.46m and made three unsuccessful attempts.
"They were the only jumpers remaining after 2.33 and engaged in a ""passing"" duel- Kynard took the lead with a first attempt clearance of 2.33, Bondarenko passed, but then cleared 2.35 on his first attempt."
"He bested that by jumping 2.33 in his first two Diamond League meets in 2013, beginning with the season's first Diamond League meet at Doha, UAE on 10 May, then again at Shanghai, China, on 18 May."
"In the final, however, Bondarenko improved greatly to win the bronze medal with a jump of 2.26 metres."
His indoor best of 2.27 dated to February 2009 and his outdoor personal best (PB) of 2.31 was set in June 2012.
"By clearing 2.41, Bondarenko also broke the Ukrainian national record of 2.40, set by Rudolf Povarnitsyn in 1985 (which was then a new world record.)"
"The jump is a European record and places him joint third on the men's all-time list, behind Javier Sotomayor and Mutaz Essa Barshim and tied with Patrik Sjöberg."
"Bondarenko was a finalist at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London on 7 August 2012, clearing 2.29 and finishing in 7th place."
"With three athletes (the other two being Derek Drouin and Mutaz Essa Barshim) still jumping at 2.41m, Bondarenko was the only one to clear that mark, thus equalling his personal best and world leading jump and breaking Javier Sotomayor's Championship record."
"On 14 June 2014, he achieved his personal best jump of 2.42 metres at the 2014 IAAF Diamond League event in New York City."
"In the 2008–09 indoor season, Bondarenko recorded a new career best as he jumped 2.27 in February in Lódz."
"May 11, Tokyo (1st, 2.40m)."
He won 8 of his first 9 competitions.
"Bondarenko did not even begin jumping until 2.28 (7' 5-3/4""), the highest ""opening"" height ever in a Diamond League event."
"On Friday 26 July, competing in yet another Diamond League meet – the Anniversary Games in London's 2012 Olympic Stadium – Bondarenko again bested Eric Kynard, winning with a jump of 2.38 (7' 9-3/4"") to Kynard's 2.36."
(Barshim clearing of 2.42 and attempt on 2.46 were much better than Bodarenko's.)
"He is one of the tallest high jumpers competing on the elite Diamond League circuit, standing 1.98 meters (6' 6"")."
"This was enough to win the gold medal, ahead of Sylwester Bednarek, who placed fourth two years earlier, and Miguel Ángel Sancho."
"Here, he entered at 2.15, passed 2.20 in his second attempt but failed at 2.25."
"Entering the 2009 European Indoor Championships, he managed to equal this height in the qualifying round, which gave him a place in the final."
"Six athletes recorded 2.14 metres, and only two of them reached the final, due to having fewer fouls in the competition."
"All of the top high jumpers were entered in the ""Golden Gala"" Diamond League meet in Rome."
"Kynard missed at 2.35, then passed to 2.37, clearing on his first attempt to retake the lead as Bondarenko passed."
Bohdan Viktorovych Bondarenko (Ukrainian: Богдан Вікторович Бондаренко; born 30 August 1989) is a Ukrainian high jumper.
"The following week at the Adidas Grand Prix, Icahn Stadium, New York City, on Saturday afternoon June 14, Bondarenko and Barshim were locked in a tight competition, with both improving to 2.42m (on their first attempts), equalling Patrick Sjoberg's former world record from 1987 as the second best jumpers outdoors in history."
"He needed to in order to win the competition, since he had passed 2.38, a height cleared by both his opponents."
Bondarenko now joins Sjoberg in possession of the European record.
"In the final, Bondarenko cleared every height from 2.08 through 2.26 on the first attempt, except for one miss at 2.21 metres."
The competition was dominated by the duel behind gold medallist Huang Haiqiang and silver medallist Niki Palli.
"In a May 2016 interview for the IAAF's official website, Bondarenko said of his father, ""I have always understood him and he has always understood me."
"Bondarenko cleared 2.41 (7 feet, 11 inches) on his third try (only his 7th jump of the competition): video of his 2.41 clearance shows him taking off nearly 4 feet away from the bar and clearing it cleanly (if only barely)."
"This time, all jumpers with 2.14 in the qualifying round passed on to the final."
"They both entered the 2017 Red Bull MotoGP Rookies Cup, Deniz finishing 4th, and Can in 3rd."
"He also scored his first Pole Position in Austria, but had to start from the back of the grid, because his Tech3 team elected to switch him to slick tyres, and finished just seconds after the three-minute board was shown."
"Luckily all riders involved miraculously walked away from the incident unscathed, and Öncü was replaced by Daniel Holgado for the two race ban."
"After the race in Austin, he was given a two race ban, after being deemed to have caused a massive incident involving clipping Jeremy Alcoba's front wheel, who went tumbling across the track, his bike being struck by Andrea Migno and Pedro Acosta, who both went airborne."
"Deniz Öncü (born 26 July 2003) is a Turkish motorcycle racer, currently competing in the Moto3 World Championship, for team Red Bull KTM Tech3."
"His twin brother, Can, is also a motorcycle racer."
"Can had been permitted to race from the start of the season, despite being below the minimum age of 16, as he received a special dispensation by Dorna after winning the 2018 Red Bull MotoGP Rookies Cup, and the 2018 Valencian Grand Prix as a wildcard."
"They would compete again in 2017, Deniz becoming champion, and Can finishing 3rd."
"Öncü continued with Tech3 for the 2021 season, and he achieved his first Moto3 podium with a 3rd place finish in Barcelona, followed by two 2nd places in Austria and Aragon."
"Just like with the Asia Talent Cup, they would try again in 2018, Deniz finishing as runner-up this time, behind his brother Can who was crowned champion."
He later said that upon arriving he reviewed the file of every priest in the diocese as a proactive measure against sexual abuse on the part of priests.
"Succeeding Bishop Kenneth Untener, Carlson was installed at St. Mary's Cathedral in Saginaw on February 24, 2005."
"He served as a pastor, a judge on the archdiocesan tribunal, director of the Office of Vocations, and chancellor of the curia in the archdiocese."
"Robert James Carlson (born June 30, 1944) is an American prelate of the Catholic Church."
"But at least in my own time in St. Louis, I'd like to have a crack at the dialogue first."
"He earned a Master of Divinity degree from St. Paul Seminary in 1976, and a Licentiate of Canon Law from the Catholic University of America School of Canon Law in 1979."
He required diocesan employees and priests transferring into his diocese to undergo thorough background checks.
"Four years earlier, Adamson had spent two weeks in an inpatient clinic after being accused of abuse of minors."
"His father was serving in the U.S. Navy on a destroyer in Guam when his son was born, and later worked as a Prudential insurance salesman for 43 years."
It appears that's the direction the church consensus is moving towards.
"However, he also affirmed the validity of denying communion to such politician as he said that ""If I were to enter into dialogue with somebody, and after they reflect on the discussion and that person persisted, it could come to that point."
"=== Bishop of Saginaw ===
Carlson was appointed as the fifth bishop of the Diocese of Saginaw on December 29, 2004."
"He received his episcopal consecration on January 11, 1984, from Archbishop John Roach, with Bishops John Kinney and Paul Dudley serving as co-consecrators."
"In 2005, Carlson's predecessor, Archbishop Burke, had excommunicated parish priest Reverend Marek Bozek and the lay board of Saint Stanislaus Kostka Parish as part of a decades-long dispute over the control of parish property, the appointment of a Polish or Polish-speaking pastor to replace Bozek, Bozek's status and compensation, and whom to recognize as a parishioner or board member."
Could we get into that situation?
"He received the pallium from the pope on June 29, 2009, in a ceremony at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome."
"He succeeded Bishop Paul Dudley as the seventh Bishop of Sioux Falls upon the latter's retirement on March 21, 1995."
"Daschle refused to disclose any details of his communication with Carlson, saying, ""I am not going to participate in a debate that is intended to politicize anyone's religious beliefs..."""
Adamson later admitted to sexually abusing children in 10 of the 13 parishes to which he was assigned.
"Soon after Carlson's arrival, the pastor of a St. Louis parish was arrested and suspended from priestly duties for alleged sexual improprieties with minors."
"In response, Daschle described the bishops as being ""more identified with the radical right than with thoughtful religious leadership."
We must continue to work and pray tirelessly for the day when every child who is conceived will have the right to live.
"=== Archbishop of St. Louis ===
Pope Benedict XVI named Carlson  as the ninth Archbishop of the Archdiocese of St. Louis on April 21, 2009."
"...Archbishop Burke, who is on the Supreme Apostolic Signatura, has combined in an interesting way, and I think he does it correctly."
"During high school, he studied under the Christian Brothers and played football."
"Carlson called the proposition a ""smokescreen"" designed to ""provide cover for pro-abortion senators and President Clinton, who wanted to avoid a veto confrontation."""
He also notified the previous parishes where the priest had served of the allegations.
He was praised for his response by the local newspaper.
...
"""During his tenure, Carlson was a frequent critic of U.S. Senator Tom Daschle (D-SD)."
"=== Priesthood ===
Carlson was ordained to the priesthood by Archbishop Leo Binz for the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis on May 23, 1970."
"""During the 2008 U.S. presidential election, Carlson stated, ""A Catholic can, in good conscience, vote for a pro-choice candidate only if other issues outweigh this one in number and in kind."""
"Carlson later added, ""I would never break off dialogue or a pastoral relationship with anyone."
"And he's not just speaking anymore as the Archbishop of St. Louis, he is the prefect of the Signatura."
Carlson visited and spoke to the parish soon afterward at one of their masses.
"The eldest of five children, Robert Carlson has four younger sisters, two of whom died in childhood."
"Carlson confronted Adamson, who admitted committing sexual abuse against children and ""agreed that it probably would be first-degree criminal sexual contact""."
"=== Auxiliary Bishop of St. Paul and Minneapolis ===
On November 19, 1983, Pope John Paul II appointed Carlson as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of St. Paul and Minneapolis and titular bishop of Avioccala."
Carlson filled the role of diocesan vocations director himself.
"The day following President Barack Obama's victory, he said, ""This election has shown that any child who is born in America has the opportunity to ascend to the highest political office in the land."
Yes.
"During his tenure in Saginaw, Carlson focused on priestly vocations, Catholic schools, service to the poor, stewardship, and evangelization."
"== Views ==
Carlson is considered theologically conservative."
"In 1997, before a US Senate vote on legislation banning so-called partial-birth abortion, Carlson denounced a compromise proposed by Daschle that would ban the procedure, but allow exemptions for women claiming mental or physical health reasons."
"Carlson, after trying to reconcile with the board and parishioners, concluded an agreement in which the archdiocese surrendered its property claims to the chruch and St. Stanislaus agreed not to claim any Catholic affiliation."
"In August 2006, the first permanent deacon in 25 years was ordained for the diocese."
"Carlson survived stage-four bladder cancer in the 1990s, having once been told by his doctor to prepare for an imminent death."
He was also the editor of two publications: Rome Gay News and O-MPO: organo del Movimento politico degli omosessuali.
"Massimo Consoli (12 December 1945 – 4 November 2007) was known as ""the father of the Italian gay movement""."

"The two adjacent camps were run on starvation rations and full of disease, including dysentery."
"Sections from this collection were read at the dedication ceremony of the Freedom Monument in 1934, which commemorates the Latvian War of Independence."
"After the death of his younger sister (third child), the Breikšs family received a permit to leave Russia on 3 October 1920."
"In 1931, Leonīds Breikšs had joined the right-wing and antisemitic political party Perkonkrusts, led by Gustavs Celmiņš."
"In June 1941 the Cheka tell Breikšs' father that he has been arrested and convicted of ""Anti-state activity according to article 58""."
He left the party very publicly in 1933 in an article published in Latvis.
"After the outbreak of World War I, Pēteris decided to move back to Moscow to keep his family safe, gaining the position as manager of the French manufacturer Girot's silk factory."
"Leonīds Breikšs (8 April 1908 – 30 September 1942) was a noted Latvian poet, journalist and nationalist."
"Dauge also acts as a mentor, encouraging Leonids to develop his poetry using the natural wildlife and geography of Latvia to express his poetry."
"After a long march during which they were stoned by the local population, by late August 1941 Breikšs was resident in the Astrakhan Khan Palace Prison, with his bunk mate Bisters."
"As the Allied and Russian armies advanced on a collapsing Nazi Germany, Anna and her son fled to Bavaria."
"On 13 April 1924, his poem ""I want to sing a song once"" was published in newspaper Jaunatnes dzive (Life of Youth), later claimed to be his first commissioned publication."
"This allowed the Soviets to invade part of south-eastern region of Finland (Karelia and Salla) in the Winter War, which after 105 days were annexed."
"During this time he wrote the poems ""Christ"" and ""Prayer"", in which he asks God for strength and resilience against evil."
"They initially worked in the repatriation of Baltic Germans to Germany, but after that worked manually in construction and farming."
"The family were Lutheran, but the nearest church was in Moscow, some 150 kilometres (93 mi) away."
"From the 18th century onwards, and during the later-half of the 19th century, Piebalga district where the family now lived was home to many early Latvian nationalists, including the former house of linguist Atis Kronvalds and a monument to his acts of patriotism."
"He wrote the noted poems ""Latvian's creed"", ""Prayer"", and ""Sacred Legacy"", which became a noted nationalist song with music by Janis Norvilis."
"This triggered Latvia and the USSR to sign a treaty in Moscow on 6 October 1939, to protect the USSR's south western border."
"Continuing his studies at Riga State Grammar school No. 1, his fellow students include Arnolds Lūsis, latterly the archbishop of the Latvian Evangelical Lutheran church, who was exiled from 1966."
"Severely physically tortured in the Cheka building in Riga, the interrogation of Breikšs was focused on members of the Latvian national resistance organization, specifically journalists: Edgars Samts, Voldemārs Krastiņš, plus students Leonids Vezis and Atis Ansis Zalitis (all later shot at Astrakhan prison on 28 November 1941)."
"After the death in March 1940 Edvarts Virza, in an unstable Latvian political environment that was highly aware of the aggressive powers to both its east and west, Soviet forces began to enforce the secret parts of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact on its neighbours, annexing: Estonia; Lithuania,; Bessarabia; Northern Bukovina; and the Hertsa region."
"During their investigation, the Cheka also arrested writers Anšlavs Eglītis and Mārtiņš Zīverts on 27 May 1941, in connection with their case against Breikšs."
Along with the nationalists the Soviet guards shot their fellow Latvian intellectuals: Ernests Brastiņš; Aleksandrs Grīns; Arveds Valtes Avots; Hugo Helmanis; Andrejs Kampe; Kārlis Krauze.
"In September 1942, Breikšs and Bisters were transferred by rail with Russian prisoners."
"Transferred to Riga Central prison in May 1941, where on 11 June he signed a ""Protocol on ceasing investigation""."

"== Early writing ==
Having been raised speaking Latvian, and mainly educated in the Russian language, as well as the German language, 12-year-old Leonīds Breikšs found it hard to fully understand the Slavic language letters."
"Educated privately at the Lutheran Marija Millere grammar school, the family also attended the local Lutheran church, which had an altarpiece titled ""Jesus blessing children"" by Janis Rozentāls."
"Aged 5, like his father, Breikšs attended the local school, and also fished the local Ogre river."
"On 17 April 1941, just after midnight with his parents in residence at the couple's apartment in Riga, Leonids is arrested by a combined force of Cheka and Soviet-controlled State police."
"So the family regularly attended the local Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church, and for each of the three younger children born while in residence on his estate, Prince Golytzin paid for a Lutheran minister to make the journey from Moscow to baptise them."
"After a reception at the Latvian Railways headquarters, they honeymooned along the River Ogre close to Vecpiebalga."
"There, 900 were then shipped by boat down the River Volga to a former horse farm now converted into a gulag at Astrakhan; the rest of the Latvian's were shipped by train further into Siberia."
"While playing Leonids/Norvilis ""Sacred Legacy"", the last announcement from the radio presenter was: ""Dievs, sveti Latviju"" (God bless Latvia)."
"After a number of visits to Riga Central Prison that all proved unfruitful, at midnight on 14 June 1941, the Cheka arrested Breikšs' brother Pēteris."
"Looking to express his isolation of living in his homeland while not being able to speak its language, Breikšs starts to write expressively in Russian aged 13."
"Following the end of World War I, the country of Latvia declared independence on 18 November 1918, which started the Latvian War of Independence."
"After trusting his mother and reading her some of his poetry, she sought the advice of theology professor Voldemars Maldonis of the University of Latvia."

"Ezeli has improved so much that he gives them the best of both worlds [offense and defense]."""
"Recalling that incident, he said, ""Everybody was running up the court, and I was just running with them."
He previously played five seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA).
"On November 6, 2015, Ezeli scored a career-high 16 points as a starter in a 119–104 win over the Denver Nuggets."
"Although Ezeli began his Vanderbilt studies as a biology major, he changed his major to economics because of the time demands of basketball."
Ezeli helped the Warriors win an NBA record 73 games to eclipse the 72 wins set by the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls.
He was immediately assigned the number 20 jersey.
"With Ogilvy gone, Ezeli had a breakout season in 2010–11, averaging 13 points and 6.3 rebounds while being named a second-team All-SEC (Southeastern Conference) performer."
"On March 2, 2021, Ezeli signed a contract with the Westchester Knicks of the NBA G League, returning to professional basketball after a 4-year hiatus dealing with multiple injuries and difficult recoveries."
It was tough.
"Vanderbilt chancellor Nicholas Zeppos said of Ezeli: ""You can imagine what it's like to hear his perspective on world trade, globalization and the economics of American sports."""
"On January 19, 2013, Ezeli had a season-best game with 13 points and 8 rebounds in 116–112 win over the New Orleans Hornets."
I tried again in 2006.
"He subsequently missed the entire 2013–14 season, returning to action for the Warriors in the team's 2014–15 season opener."
Ezeli won his first NBA championship after the Warriors defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2015 NBA Finals in six games.
"On March 8, 2017, he underwent surgery on his left knee and was ruled out for the entire 2016–17 season."
"But we all understood if the payday came, if it really came, if he understood the game, if he was experienced, then it was going to give him a chance to be different than other guys."
I think it's very rare.
He also broke Will Perdue's Vanderbilt single-season record for blocked shots.
"On July 6, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Warriors."
"My first name is Ifeanyi, and that means 'nothing is impossible with God'."
He was trying to learn the game while competing effectively in the SEC.
"=== Recruitment ===
Ezeli's appearance at the camp marked a major turning point in his life."
"The Warriors, with the help of Ezeli, advanced deep into the postseason to win the Western Conference Finals against James Harden and the Houston Rockets in a 4–1 series."
He returned to action on April 3 against the Portland Trail Blazers after missing 31 games.
"However, as early as midway through his redshirt freshman season, the Commodores staff noticed that Ogilvy was beginning to have difficulty scoring against Ezeli in practice."
The Warriors' NBA-record start ended after 24 wins when they lost to the Milwaukee Bucks 108–95 on December 12.
"As the Commodores were preparing for Ezeli's final season at Vanderbilt, Stallings said about him,""He now has a feel for the game."
"During his first two years in the program, while still learning many of the basics of the sport, he was frequently dominated in practice by Ogilvy."
"That sets the tone for my journey while I'm alive."""
"On August 23, 2016, he was ruled out for six weeks after undergoing a left knee injection."
Ezeli won an NBA Championship with the Warriors in 2015.
"By not attending full-time, he retained a full four years of college eligibility and was still able to practice with the team; he also served as the team's videographer."
"The following day, he sprained his left ankle in a loss to the Los Angeles Lakers and was confined to a moon boot."
"The Vanderbilt coaching staff sold him on the school, citing its academic reputation and the program's recent experience with international players."
"=== Westchester Knicks (2021) ===
On July 7, 2016, Ezeli signed with the Portland Trail Blazers."
"On February 8, 2016, he underwent successful arthroscopic surgery to clean out debris from his left knee and was subsequently ruled out for six weeks."
"And when I had my first dunk in a summer league game in Las Vegas in 2006, that's when I was so excited."
"On June 30, 2017, he was waived by the Trail Blazers before appearing in a game for them."
"=== Life in America ===
Shortly after Ezeli arrived in Yuba City, his uncle encouraged him to take up what seemed to be the most appropriate sport for a 6'8"" (2.03 m) teenager—basketball."
"Ifeanyi Festus Ezeli-Ndulue (born October 21, 1989) is a Nigerian-American professional basketball player."
"He concentrated on academics, graduating from high school while still age 14, and aspiring to become a physician."
Everyone was getting frustrated with me.
"Two months later, he suffered a minor setback in his comeback from the procedure, with swelling in his left knee."
He didn't learn the game in elementary school like I did.
"On August 1, 2015, Ezeli played for Team Africa at the 2015 NBA Africa exhibition game."
"== College career ==
Ezeli arrived in Nashville in 2007 as a biology major and among the rawest of basketball prospects."
"The start of his organized basketball career, with a low-level AAU team, was especially inauspicious; his first points were scored in his own team's basket."
It's kind of surreal.
"Although still learning the most basic of basketball skills, he made his high-level competitive debut on the AAU circuit in the summer of 2007."
"As a rookie in 2012–13, Ezeli started many games for the Warriors in place of injured center Andrew Bogut."
"On April 17, 2021, Ezeli signed with Rivers Hoopers to play in the inaugural season of the Basketball Africa League (BAL)."
"They left with their heads spinning at Ezeli's size and raw potential, even if it was clear that he lacked confidence."
"On February 2, he was recalled by Golden State after successfully competing in two D-League games."
"Ezeli's improvement was noted by many in the basketball world; then-Tennessee coach Bruce Pearl told the Chattanooga Times Free Press, ""I don't think they miss [Ogilvy] at all."
All of us are looking for more finished products.
"On December 22, 2014, he scored a then-career-high 15 points in a 128–108 win over the Sacramento Kings."
He played college basketball for Vanderbilt before being selected with the 30th overall pick in the 2012 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors.
"In mid-December, it became apparent to the Trail Blazers that conservative treatment of Ezeli's aching left knee wasn't working, and that season-ending surgery was imminent."
I was getting frustrated with it.
I tried playing in 2005.
"In the 2015 NBA playoffs, Ezeli logged key minutes as the first big man off Golden State's bench, often filling in for the foul-prone Andrew Bogut."
"The injury kept him out all of January, when on January 28, he was assigned to the Santa Cruz Warriors of the NBA Development League for rehabilitation."
He has made himself an effective player.
"In June 2013, Ezeli was ruled out for six to nine months after undergoing surgery on his right knee."
"This proved much more difficult for him than academics; although he had played soccer as a child, he had never played any organized sports."
"The following day, he made his return for Golden State, playing eight minutes of action in a win over the Sacramento Kings."
"He took a year of classes at Jesuit High School in Sacramento, but did not play basketball; different sources report that he was either ineligible to play because he had graduated from high school in Nigeria or cut during tryouts."
"Imagine someone who is 14 or 15 years old, and you're teaching them as if they're a 6-year-old."
He appeared in two games.
I stopped.
"He was responsible for the supervision of United States security assistance programs, nuclear nonproliferation and the implementation of the State Department's international scientific and technological programs."
"He was liaison with various government departments relating to domestic violence following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and during the Poor People's Campaign in Washington, DC in 1968."

"In December 1979, he was promoted to the post of Under Secretary for Security Assistance, Science and Technology."
He also continued to be responsible for supervising US policy on the eastern Mediterranean and eastern European countries.
"The United Nations mediator of this dispute was Cyrus Vance, former US Secretary of State, and Nimetz worked with Vance to assist the parties to reach agreement on a number of important points, which culminated in the signing of the Interim Agreement of September 13, 1995, by Greece and its northern neighbor, now officially known as the Republic of North Macedonia (but at that time admitted to the United Nations under the temporary designation ""The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia""),  at the United Nations which resolved many of the issues between the two countries."
He was the United Nations Special Representative for the naming dispute between Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (now North Macedonia).
He worked for a nominal salary of US$1 a year in order to find a solution suitable for all concerned.
"In that capacity he provided advice to Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and had special responsibilities in connection with the Cyprus issue, Eastern Mediterranean issues including Greek-Turkish disputes, implementation of the Helsinki Accords and other issues involving Eastern/Central Europe, Mexico–United States border issues, the Micronesian status negotiations, and other matters."

"From March 1994 to September 1995, he served as President Bill Clinton's Special Envoy to mediate the resolution of the Macedonian Issue, an important regional dispute that the United Nations Security Council had acted upon, involving both a national name and related disputes."
"Following his stay at the White House, he worked with the New York City law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett as an associate from 1969 to 1973 and as a partner from 1974 to 1977."
"After the end of the Carter Administration in January 1981, Nimetz returned to the private sector."
"He became a partner in the New York law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, where he concentrated in corporate and international law."
"Nimetz has continued to work mediating between Greece and the Republic of North Macedonia, for more than two decades."
"During his 19-year tenure at the Paul Weiss law firm he served on the Executive Committee, as chair of the firm and as head of the corporate department."

After the war, he advocated forming a new Christian party of both Catholics and Protestants."
Muller was arrested during the Nazis first raid on Military Intelligence in 1943.
Anatomie einer konservativen Partei 1945–1972.
Hitler's swift victories over France and the Low Countries deflated the will of the German military to resist Hitler.
"Dohnanyi summarized the material into a report, containing list of individuals slated to assume roles in a post-coup civilian government."
"Negotiations were tense, with a Western offensive expected, and on the basis that substantive negotiations could only follow the replacement of the Hitler regime."
The Vatican agreed to send a letter outlining the basis for peace with England and the participation of the Pope was used to try to persuade senior German Generals Halder and Brauchitsch to act against Hitler.
"Hans Oster, Wilhelm Canaris and Hans von Dohnányi, backed by Beck, told Müller to ask Pius to ascertain whether the British would enter negotiations with the German opposition which wanted to overthrow Hitler."
"== Early life ==
Born in Steinwiesen, Bavaria, Müller was a lifelong Catholic."
"Unlike fellow inmates Canaris, Oster and Bonhoeffer, who were executed in April 1945, Müller was spared at the last moment, at the foot of the scaffold, through the intervention of Johann Rattenhuber who convinced Ernst Kaltenbrunner that keeping Müller alive might help Germany negotiate more favourable surrender terms."
He was a member of the resistance during World War II and afterwards one of the founders of the Christian Social Union (CSU).
Müller belonged to the more liberal wing of the party and was the main opponent of the more conservative wing under Alois Hundhammer.
"The Pope's Private Secretary, Robert Leiber, acted as the intermediary for Pius and met with Müller, who visited Rome in 1939 and 1940."
"Nevertheless, the resistance were encouraged by the talks, and Muller told Leiber that a coup would occur in February."
"After the CSU had won the first postwar elections in 1946, Hundhammer opposed Müller's nomination as minister-president of Bavaria and proposed for Hans Ehard to be elected as a compromise candidate instead."
"Josef Müller (27 March 1898 – 12 September 1979), also known as ""Ochsensepp"" (""Joe Ox""), was a German politician."
The Vatican considered Müller to be a representative of Colonel-General Beck and agreed to offer the machinery for mediation between the German Resistance and the Allies.
"Instead, Müller was transferred to Tyrol in late April 1945 along with 138 other ""special prisoners"" (Sonderhäftlinge) and ""kin prisoners"" (Sippenhäftlinge), persons of prominence the Nazi SS had hauled off in the final days of the war to Niederdorf, South Tyrol, where they were to be hidden and used as bargaining chips."
"The British agreed to negotiate, provided the Vatican could vouch for the opposition's representative."
"Pius, communicating with Britain's Francis d'Arcy Osborne, channelled communications back and forth in secrecy."
"The correspondence and related intelligence passed through an intermediary to the hands of Pope Pius XII, who would review it and in turn forward it to Lord Halifax in Britain."
Pius appeared to continue to hope for a coup in Germany into March 1940.
He carried correspondence between the German resistance and British intelligence that sought co-operation in a coup to replace Hitler's regime with an anti-Nazi civilian government supported by the German military.
"=== Imprisonment ===
After his arrest in 1943 he was interned at the concentration camp Flossenbürg."
The negotiations ultimately proved fruitless.

"The sale of Angel Stadium and its land for $320 million to the Anaheim Angels is alleged to have violated state law, specifically the Surplus Land Act, which requires public agencies to prioritize affordable housing, parks, and open space when they sell public property."
"== Mayoral career ==
Per an affidavit by FBI Special Agent Brian Adkins, Sidhu is under investigation for having violated numerous federal statutes."
The release of this information prompted the State of California Attorney General Rob Bonta to suspend a pending settlement with the City of Anaheim regarding the Angel Stadium sale.
He was the first person of color and the first Sikh to serve as mayor of Anaheim.
"On May 16, 2022, a court filing by the California Superior Court, County of Orange, stated that Sidhu is under investigation by the FBI and an Orange County Grand Jury for potential criminal conduct related to the sale of the Angel Stadium property, and for his actions related to the registering of a personal aircraft at a false out-of-state address."
"These potential violations include: honest services fraud, theft or bribery concerning programs receiving federal funds, wire fraud, mail fraud, false statements, obstruction of justice, and witness tampering."
"Harry S. Sidhu (born July 8, 1957) is an American Republican politician and businessman who served as the 46th mayor of Anaheim, California, winning the office in the 2018 election."
"She still cannot see well, and she can only use her right hand, since the left is paralyzed."
She... read a number of Catholic books.
"After briefly sightseeing and listening to the lectures of Prof. Kuno Fischer, Anna and Dmitrii Abrikosov continued on to Girton College, where he left his sister behind."
"The memoirs of Dmitrii Abrikosov ""describes their childhood as carefree and joyous"" and writes that their English governess ""was quite shocked at the close relationship between parents and children."""
"""According to Dmitrii Abrikosov, ""As for my sister, nothing was heard about her for nine years and even my eldest brother, who worked for the Soviets and became a prominent scientist, could do nothing for her."
"""During the preparation of Dmitrii Abrikosov's memoirs for publication in the early 1960s, Anna's cousin and adopted brother, Mr. Pavel Nikolaevich Abrikosov of Montreal, assisted editor George Alexander Lensen."
"Unimpressed, I continued my attempts to change my sister's mind, not sparing in my letters the object of her affections, with the result that one day I received a short note in which she pointed out that I had forgotten one thing, namely that she loved him."
"""Despite warnings that it could lead to another arrest, Mother Catherine also reestablished ties to the surviving Sisters."
"Sister Philomena Ejsmont later recalled, ""Mother Catherine loved children; they always had access to her room and simply adored her."
"Upon their return, the Abrikosovs found a group of Dominican tertiaries which had been established earlier by one Natalia Rozanova."
"=== Early life ===
Anna Ivanovna Abrikosova was born on 23 January 1882 in Kitaigorod, Moscow, Russian Empire."
"Mother knew how to devise clever, fun diversions for the children."
"There was a rather large circle of laypeople, besides the nuns."
She particularly liked the Dialogue of Saint Catherine of Siena and began to doubt official Orthodoxy more and more.
"She was also the foundress of a Byzantine Catholic community of the Third Order of St. Dominic which has gained wide attention, even among secular historians of Soviet repression."
"""For the children of parishioners who did not wish to expose their children to the forced indoctrination into Marxist-Leninist atheism common in the Soviet educational system, Mother Catherine, Father Nikolai, and the sisters founded a secret and illegal Catholic school."
To their great surprise the Pope refused outright... and reminded them of the provisions of Orientalium dignitas.
"They both thought they would stay abroad, where they had full freedom of religion and... a vague plan to join some monastery or semi-monastic community."
"""In her work as a literary translator, Anna Abrikosova translated Jean-Baptiste Henri Lacordaire's biography of St. Dominic from French to Russian."
"""Anna (1882-1936) and Vladimir (1880-1966) Abrikosov."""
"While at Girton, Lady Dorothy, who later became a prominent suffragette, wrote regular letters to her mother, which remain one of the best sources for Anna's college days."
"Since they knew that according to the canons they were Greek-Catholics, they petitioned Pius X through a Roman prelate for permission to become Roman Catholics -- they considered this a mere formality."
"According to the 1924 ""Investigatory File of A.I. Abrikosova and Others"" in the Central Archive of the FSB, the OGPU decided to interpret the convent and its tiny parochial school as a terrorist organization plotting to overthrow the Soviet Government and, ""the organization of illegal schools for the education of children in a religious-fascist spirit""."
"For every New Year, wonderful festivities were arranged, with costume parties and skits."
"The other, whom Howard referred to only as ""Sandro"", was alleged in a letter dated January 18, 1904, either, ""out of dispetto"", (""spite"") or having possibly, ""ceased to care for Ania"", to have recently become engaged to a princess and junior member of the British royal family."
"On August 14, she walked free from Butyrka and went directly to the Church of St. Louis des Français."
"Mother Catherine declined and wrote in a letter, ""I  wish to live a uniquely supernatural life and to accomplish to the end my vow of immolation for the priests and for Russia."
"The answer lay, of course in their wonderful character."
"According to Lesley Chamberlain, every person deported aboard the ship had been hand-picked by Vladimir Lenin, who wished to rid himself of the first Soviet dissidents."
"Her father, Ivan Alexeievich Abrikosov, was expected to take over the family firm until his premature death from tuberculosis."
"""Every year, the summers were spent at ""The Oaks"", a country estate at Tarasovka, Moscow Governorate, which Nikolai Abrikosov had purchased from an ethnic German businessman."
"On 19 May 1917, Vladimir was ordained to the priesthood by Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church."
"Soon after, Mother Catherine and her mother-in-law were offered the opportunity to leave the Soviet Union and join Father Vladimir as White emigres in Paris."
"""Shortly before the Supreme Collegium of the OGPU handed down sentences, Mother Catherine told the sisters of her community, ""Probably every one of you, having given your love to God and following in His way, has in your heart more than once asked Christ to grant you the opportunity to share in His sufferings."
"She used to say that in England, ""children were seen and not heard."""
"She later told interrogators, ""After my release from the isolator and happening to be in Moscow, I renewed my links with a group of people whom an OGPU Collegium had condemned in 1923."
"The habit of meditating about higher matters made a real philosopher of him; unperturbed by the little things of this life, he faced all difficulties with absolute calmness."
My uncle... had no interest in the innumerable businesses created by my grandfather and passed his spare time in his library or the laboratory.
"According to a letter from Mother Catherine to Princess Volkonskaya, the Patriarch was deeply hurt by this, ""and his kindness to us has been dampened."
"It is something inexplicable, a characteristic trait of panic."
"""With her brother Dmitrii acting as her chaperone during the journey to England, Anna first visited their brother Ivan, who was studying mathematics at the University of Heidelberg."
"Dmitrii Abrikosov later recalled, ""We were healthy children, quickly became friends with our new brothers and sisters, and filled the big house of our uncle with perpetual noise."
"Anna later told Lady Dorothy Howard, ""Every day as I went into the room the girls would divide up the passage and stand aside not to brush me as I passed because they hated me as one of the privileged class."
"Richter later wrote, ""A friend whom I especially was valued was Ania Abrikossova (sic)."
"After a scandalous and almost immediate separation, Anna's adopted father, Nikolai Abrikosov, had defied the orders of their mother and had taken his sister in."
They idolized her.
"Richter added, ""As was customary at that time, we were photographed together."""
This would have been even more the case in Anna Abrikosova's immediate family.
One must thoroughly understand the psychology of the Russian attitude toward the Jesuits.
"DOMINIC IN RED MOSCOW,"" by Kathleen West."
The latter home had reportedly been a prison during the 18th-century and had survived the Great Fire of Moscow in 1812.
She went on reading and came to prefer the Dominican spirituality and to enjoy Lacordaire's biography of Saint Dominic...
There were about ten or twelve children.
Your desire to suffer for His sake is now being fulfilled.
"According to Father Georgii Friedman, ""The only composition of Mother Catherine that survived intact is The Seven Words of Christ on the Cross."
It was a huge apartment.
"The NKVD further alleged that the nuns' terrorist activities were directed by Bishop Pie Eugène Neveu, the Vatican's Congregation for the Oriental Churches, and Pope Pius XI."
"Father Vladimir Abrikosov, along with his protege and former Old Bolshevik Dmitry Kuzmin-Karavayev, were arrested and sentenced to the supreme penalty of death by shooting."
"She never stopped thinking of Russia, but like many other people, she thought that only the Roman Catholic priests were able to work with Russian souls."
"Bishop Pie Eugène Neveu, who had been secretly consecrated by Michel d'Herbigny as an underground Bishop in 1926, wrote to Rome after meeting her at St. Louis des Français, ""This woman is a genuine preacher of the Faith and very courageous."
"In spite of my entire respect for this religious order, I must admit that it much not enter Russia."
It was further alleged that the nuns planned to restore Capitalism and for collective farms to be privatized and returned to the kulaks and the Russian nobility.
"== Moscow ==
The couple returned to Russia in 1910."
"Her paternal grandmother had forced her 17-year old aunt, Glafira Abrikosova, into an arranged marriage to a much older member of the Russian nobility, who had no intention of remaining faithful."
"My sister was not an exception to the general rule, but under the influence of our English governess chose an English college; the whole family approved wholeheartedly, for thereby she would be free from politics and the pressure to bow down to the tyranny of solidarity in holding extreme views expected of serious women."
"The operation removed her left breast, part of the muscles on her back and side."
I would even be so bold as to say that the level of this work is no less than the writings of Saint Theresa of Avila.
Its arrival here will be the ruin of all that has been accomplished.
"In reestablishing contact with them, my purpose was to assess their political and spiritual condition after their arrest, administrative exile and the expiration of their residence restriction."
"At the time, Anna's brother, Dmitrii Abrikosov, had become a highly ambitious diplomat and was stationed by the Foreign Office at the Russian Embassy in London, which was then located at Chesham House, Belgravia."
"Therefore, Dmitrii Abrikosov was horrified to learn of his sister's engagement."
"In the tiniest little chapel they had made an altar out of a dresser, and on the altar stood a crucifix."
"According to experts, however, on the culture of the Kupechestvo (""The Russian Merchant Class"") during the last decades of the House of Romanov, intermarriage between elite Moscow mercantile families and the aristocracy was widely frowned upon, as aristocratic suitors were widely presumed to be golddiggers."
"Anna Ivanovna Abrikosova (Russian: Анна Ивановна Абрикосова; 23 January 1882 – 23 July 1936), later known as Mother Catherine of Siena, O.P. (Russian: Екатери́на Сие́нская, transcribed Ekaterina Sienskaya), was a Russian Greek-Catholic religious sister, literary translator, and victim of Joseph Stalin's concentration camps."
"According to Pavel Abrikosov, Anna and Vladimir, as first cousins, had difficulty obtaining an Orthodox wedding."
"Instead, she was told that she could leave any time she wanted."
"Friedman later recalled, ""I remember how the atmosphere of quiet and peace in their quarters delighted me."
"She was a wonderfully nice and exceptionally refined person, never angry and equally kind to everybody; to her relatives and friends, the ten (and after the birth of another boy eleven) children and the numerous nurses, housekeepers, governesses, and other servants rich Russian families in days past."
"When I was older I often asked how my uncle and aunt, who were both young, loved to have a social life and receive guests, could so readily have reconciled themselves to the doubling of family."
"On 21 December 1909, Vladimir was also received into the Catholic Church."
"We were like all other children, fed and cared for."
"In a memoir written decades later, she recalled, ""My entire childhood was spent within this community, at 23 Prechistenskii Boulevard, Apartment 34."
Such is the fate of this remarkable woman.
"On the feast of St. Dominic in August 1917, Anna took vows as a Dominican Sister, assuming her religious name at that time, and founded a Greek-Catholic religious congregation of the Order in her Moscow apartment."
"In a letter to Rome, she wrote, ""Does Rome realize the terror and revulsion felt here until recently towards the Jesuits and the strange mood in which their arrival is awaited?"
"Furthermore, because Soviet dissident Alexander Solzhenitsyn interviewed surviving Greek-Catholic Dominican Sister Nora Rubashova in Moscow during his research process, Mother Catherine and the persecution of her monastic community are mentioned briefly in the first volume of The Gulag Archipelago."
"=== Girton College ===
Although heartbroken, Anna then decided to pursue an old dream of attending Girton College, the all-girls adjunct to Cambridge University."
"On August 13, 1932, Mother Catherine petitioned to be returned to Yaroslavl."
It was the end of our friendship.
"After being diagnosed with breast cancer, she was transferred to Butyrka Prison infirmary for an operation in May 1932."
"He later recalled, ""When she wrote to me about her feelings I was horrified and promptly warned her that it was madness."
"But at that time, I did not know this."
There was a chapel in one room and there was also a convent.
A lamp flickered in a beautiful vessel to show that the Blessed Sacrament was reserved there.
My sister herself would have called it the dream of a madman.
Quite a lot of people used to come.
Nikolai Abrikosov then spent the next decade bribing corrupt civil service officials working in the Most Holy Synod until he finally obtained the signature of Tsar Alexander III on a document granting his sister Glafira an Orthodox ecclesiastical divorce.
"She also befriended Lady Dorothy Georgiana Howard, the daughter of the 9th Earl and ""Radical Countess"" of Carlisle."
"The memoirs of Anna's brother Dmitrii allege that their parents had longed for a daughter, but that their mother, Anna Dmitrievna (née Arbuzova), died while giving birth to Anna, and their father died ten days later, of tuberculosis."
"The sentence, however, was commuted to perpetual exile and deportation to the West aboard the Philosopher's Ship."
I was proud of her.
"I even wrote to my father asking him to stop this nonsense, but with his usual philosophy he replied that it was a law of nature for strong characters to be attracted to weaklings, because in their love there was always a touch of motherly feeling."
"In what the NKVD called ""The Case of the Counterrevolutionary Terrorist-Monarchist Organization"", Mother Catherine and her fellow nuns stood accused of forming a ""terrorist organization"", plotting to assassinate Joseph Stalin, overthrow the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and restore the House of Romanov as a constitutional monarchy in concert with ""international fascism"" and ""Papal theocracy""."
"The nuns' co-conspirators were alleged to be the Holy See, the Republic of Lithuania, the Second Polish Republic, exiled Ukrainian People's Republic leader Symon Petliura, Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky of the Ukrainian Catholic Church, the Grand Duke Kiril Vladimirovich and the House of Romanov Government-in-Exile, ""the Supreme Monarchist Council"", and, ""International Fascism."
"""Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, some Russian Catholics, most of whom were directly linked to the surviving Abrikosov Dominican Sisters, began to appear in the open."
On the walls hung large images of Saint Dominic and Saint Catherine of Siena.
The rest of the year was spent in the family's Moscow house near Chistye Prudy.
"A ""Family Chronicle"" by Khrisanf Abrikosov, however, alleges that Anna's mother, who was suffering from postpartum depression and unable to face the imminent death of her husband from tuberculosis, in reality committed suicide by taking poison."
"Dmitrii Abrikosov later recalled of his sister, ""She had been my closest friend during my stay in England."
"== Catholicism ==
The Abrikosovs spent the next decade traveling in the Kingdom of Italy, Switzerland and France."
"Her brother Dmitrii Ivanovich later wrote, ""In those days Russian girls did not think of amusement but of study, going on to the university, studying medicine, and mixing in politics."
She herself wrote some meditations based on the liturgical year and Dominican feast days.
"For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts higher than your thoughts."
"Another member of Anna Abrikosova's six closest friends at Girton College was the future archaeologist Gisela Richter, who was studying Classics."
"""One of the schoolchildren was Father Nikolai Alexandrov's daughter, Ekaterina Nikolaevna (née Alexandrova) Mikhailova."
And so it is; the moment has now arrived.
"One was codenamed ""Prince So-and-So""."
"According to Father Georgii Friedman, ""In addition to the three usual religious vows, the Sisters took a fourth vow, to suffer for the salvation of Russia."
"Finally, she approached the parish priest of the large, aristocratic Church of the Madeleine in Paris, Abbé Maurice Rivière, who later became Bishop of Périgueux."
Then suddenly she reappeared in Moscow.
"Especially in The Third Word one can see the personal, burning pain of voluntary suffering borne by Mother Catherine - the renunciation, and then even the separation from, her ardently loved spouse."
"Little by little, she won her husband over to her religious convictions."
"When I was in Japan, some Catholic told me that he had read in a Catholic magazine that the Church was collecting all data on her life with a view to possibly consecrating her as a Saint of the Catholic Church."
He instructed and received her into the Catholic Church on 20 December 1908.
"According to Dmitrii Abrikosov, ""Till her last moments she never thought of herself, and tried to help and support by her faith other unfortunate prisoners."
"Chains were sometimes still visible on the walls and the house was said, by the servants, to be haunted by the ghost of Vanka Kain, an infamous, ""gangster, kidnapper, [and] burglar"", who was, ""the scourge of Moscow during the 1730s and '40s"", and who, despite eventually becoming a police informant, remained a local folk hero."
"New Blackfriars, June 1925."
"Amazingly, especially at that time, he informed her that even though she had been received with the Latin Ritual, she would always canonically belong to the Greek-Catholic Church."
"He never regretted what might have been, and was always reconciled with the facts of life."
"It was not an exact copy that was preserved, but what we have gives us an idea of the very lofty spirituality of the author."
"On the night of 17 August 1922, the GPU raided the convent during Orthros."
One feels insignificant beside someone of this moral stature.
Relatives who saw her wrote to my aunt in Paris that she gave the impression of a Saint.
They all slept on the floor.
Several of the women among the secular tertiaries joined her in taking vows as well.
"During the day, it looked like any well-appointed apartment with a living room, kitchen, and everything else; but at night, at least thirty nuns were staying there."
"Her brothers included senior Russian Foreign Office official Dmitri Ivanovich Abrikosov and Alexei Ivanovich Abrikosov, the doctor who embalmed Vladimir Lenin and later served as the personal physician to Joseph Stalin."
"In an anthology of women's memoirs from the GULAG, historian Veronica Shapovalova describes Anna Abrikosova as, ""a woman of remarkable erudition and strength of will"", who, ""managed to organize the sisters in such a way that even after their arrest they continued their work."""
Anna's cousin and adopted brother Khrisanf Abrikosov was a close friend of novelist Leo Tolstoy and a senior member of the latter's religious movement.
"Richter alleges that all seven friendships, ""lasted all our lives."
"""After her release from the Gulag in 1953, Abrikosova Dominican Sister Theresa Kugel became the driving force in the reunion of the surviving sisters and their monastic revival inside a Khrushchyovka apartment building on Dzuku Street in Vilnius."
"The Abrikosov family ran a company which was the official supplier of confections, gingerbread, candies, and jams to the Russian Imperial Court and had accordingly been raised to the hereditary nobility by Tsar Alexander III."
"Anna's grandfather, the industrialist Alexei Ivanovich Abrikosov, was the founder of the family fortune."
"Very likely, these were both among the reasons why, after Anna Abrikosova left Girton College without receiving a degree, she returned to Moscow and accepted a marriage proposal from her first cousin, Vladimir Abrikosov."
"She then entered a teacher's college, where the all-female student body ostracized and bullied her for being from a wealthy family."
"""Dmitrii continues, ""His wife, my aunt Vera, with whom he lived for fifty-three years through all the vicissitudes of fortune, was his chief support in life."
As a result everybody thought only of pleasing her.
"== Marriage ==
Lady Dorothy Howard's letters make occasional references to Anna Abrikosova receiving attentions from aristocratic suitors."
"If the Jesuits enter Russia in civilian dress, it will mean only the worst: their arrival here will be considered a giant Catholic conspiracy."
"The atmosphere in the community was friendly, with everyone being hard workers and no one being forced to do anything against her will."
"He supported Domagk's research on phagocytosis, an immune process discovered by Russian zoologist Elie Metchnikoff, so far as permitting excessive use of electricity, constant photographic lights, and free roaming of experimental mice, all of which angered the janitor."
He immediately entered the Bismarck School where he completed elementary education in 1910.
"In 1952, he was elected chairman of the German Society of Pathology."
"However, the Nazi Germany banned him from attending the award ceremony."
Prontosil was used as the common name for both and the brand name of the drug after 1935.
"He showed that the compound could destroy cancer cells such as Yoshida sarcoma, Ehrlich carcinoma and Crocker sarcoma of mice and the Walker carcinoma of rats."
He joined the German Grenadier Regimen 7 as a volunteer along with 15 of his old school friends.
"On 27 October 1939, Domagk received a telegram from the rector of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm that he was to receive the Nobel Prize."
His duty was to test chemical compounds prepared at the IG Farben laboratory for potential drugs.
"Domagk's thesis ""Destroying infectious diseases through the reticuloendothelium and the development of amyloid"", published in 1924 in Virchows Archiv für pathologische Anatomie und Physiologie und für klinische Medizin (now Virchows Archiv) was assessed as a worthy criterion for promotion to a full professor."
"This discouraged him from human clinical trials, but he encountered one woman who was terminally ill from puerperal fever."
Domagk had used only the Streptozon type.
"In 1923, he met Walter Gross, the Director of the Institute of Pathology at the University of Greifswald, at the conference of German Society of Pathology in Leipzig."
"After the war, in 1947, Domagk was finally able to receive his Nobel Prize, but not the monetary portion of the prize due to the time that had elapsed."
"He was transferred to eastern front in Poland in December 1914, where he was shot on the head."
The compound was then labelled KL730 (KL for Klarer).
He changed his focus to tuberculosis and chemotherapy.
"In 1925, he married Gertrude Strube, at the time an advisor to the German Chamber of Commerce in Basel."
In 1941 Domagk was awarded the Medaglia Paterno (Rome) by the Kingdom of Italy and also the Von-Klebelsberg-Medal and Prize by the Kingdom of Hungary.
He induced infection at the belly (peritonitis) of mice using clinical specimens (isolates) of Streptococcus pyogenes.
He designated a code for the compound D 4145 (D for Domagk).
He is credited with the discovery of sulfonamidochrysoidine (KL730) as an antibiotic for which he received the 1939 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.
"They suspected that a unique chemical component of sulphonamide group in the new dye could be a possible drug candidate; as Mietzsch predicted: ""[The sulphonamide parts were] the right substituents in the right positions on the azo group."""
"In the same year, Domagk was also awarded the Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh."
"This was because Carl von Ossietzky, an outspoken anti-Nazi pacifist, had won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1935, who which had angered the Nazi German government."
The medical application was soon supported by other clinical cases and Prontosil became the major antibiotic for the next decade.
"With Méave Kenny, he treated 64 women and reported the experiments and clinical trials in 1936."
"At Münster, Domagk felt that the new department was not flourishing as he anticipated and was underpaid."
"However, Domagk's work on sulfonamides eventually led to the development of the antituberculosis drugs thiosemicarbazone and isoniazid, which helped to curb the epidemic of tuberculosis which swept Europe after World War II."
"He informed the rector of the University of Münster, Walter Mevius, who immediately submitted a petition to the German authorities to allow Domagk to receive the award."
"However, Hildegarde recovered following the Prontosil treatment and her arm was saved."
"As the First World War broke out, the university was closed and he returned to Sommerfeld."
"=== Cancer therapy ===
Since 1936, Domagk also focussed on cancer treatment."
"Between 1922 and 1923, he worked as an assistant to Georg Hoppe-Seyler at Kiel."
"After making 14 incisions, the physician suggested that the only way to save Hildegarde was amputation of the arm."
"In addition, the sulphonamides by themselves were not antibacterials, but only became active drug after metabolism inside the body."
"She fell on the stairs and stabbed her hand with the needle, and the broken needle was stuck in her wrist."
His father Paul Richard Domagk was a school teacher.
"By 1935, Mietzsch and Klarer had prepared two forms of the compound, one is poorly soluble in water while the other is highly soluble."
"He received the El Soleil del Perú in 1952, the Pour le mérite für Wissenschaften und Künste in 1952, the Spanish Civil de Sanidad in 1953, the del Lobertador from the Republic of Venezuela in 1957, the Medal of the Rising Sun 2nd Class from Japan in 1960, the Grand Cross with Star of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1955."
Later they had three sons and a daughter.
"However, Gross was appointed to the University of Münster, and he invited Domagk to join him as a lecturer at his proposed Department of Experimental Pathology."
His doctoral thesis titled Beeinflussung der Kreatininausscheidung durch Muskelarbeit (Influence of Creatinine Excretion in the Urine through Muscular Activity) was supervised by Max Buerger and with that he earned his degree in 1921.
In spite of numerous incisions the inflammation phlegmon extended to the under-arm.
"Domagk was chosen to receive the 1939 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine ""for the discovery of the antibacterial effects of prontosil,"" but the Nazi government prohibited him from receiving the award."
"There were several more experimental tests, and a clinical trial in which a boy was cured of streptococcal infection in 1933."
"Since further surgical intervention was not possible, I asked permission of the treating surgeon to use Prontosil, after I had established by culture that streptococci were the cause of the illness."
"The compound had an addition of sulphonamide group as a side chain, thus becoming sulfamidochrysoidine."
"For example, German biologist Paul Ehrlich used methylene blue, a type of azo dye, to kill malarial parasites in experimental animals, and cured two persons from malaria in 1891."
"In his first experience of war at Flanders in October 1914, he barely escaped death where 11 of his school friends were killed."
The IG Farben branch at Elberfeld (later Wuppertal) noticed him and offered him to lead their institute of experimental pathology.
The other related compound received patent  in December 1932.
"In 1937, Adolf Hitler made an official decree that prohibited German nationals to accept the Nobel Prize."
Initial experiments in 1931 indicated poor antibacterial effect against bacterial cultures.
"An account that the IG Farben leader Heinrich Hörlein suggested the use of sufur group to azo dyes ""some time in 1932"" may not be true, as IG Farben received the patent of the first modified sulfamidochrysoidine on 7 November 1931."
"== Nobel Prize and issues ==
In 1939, Domagk was selected by the Nobel Foundation to receive the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of Prontosil as an antibiotic, the first commercially available drug effective against bacterial infections."
"After a series of tests with different bacteria, he published in 1935 as a disinfectant, naming it Zephirol."
It led to a successful marketing as a common disinfectant.
He was released when he was verified that he supported the German National Socialism and was politically loyal.
"All the Prontosil-injected mice survived, meaning they were cured of the streptococcal infection, whereas the untreated 14 mice all died by the fourth day of experiment."
"However, he was informed to communicate with Karolinska Institute only through the government departments such as the Ministry of Education or Foreign Office, and forced to decline the award."
"In 1935, Domagk's only daughter, Hildegarde, injured herself and contracted a streptococcal infection."
"The water-soluble compound was given a name Streptozon (specifically Streptozon S, for the soluble sodium salt) after the bacterium with which it was originally experimented, and the less water-soluble was called Prontosil (specifically Prontosil rubrum)."
"I then swore, in case I would return to my home alive, to work and work to make a small contribution to solve that problem."
"When he informed of this opportunity to his university authority in July 1927, and that he would stay if at least he was given a position of associate professor; he never received a response."
"However, she developed severe inflammation and fever from the next day."
Ossietzky was imprisoned and died in a concentration camp.
"It was not known at the time that the active component of Prontosil was the sulphonamide and not the azo group, as they expected."
"Sulfonamides had revolutionary antibacterial effectiveness for their time, surpassing phage therapy, but were later replaced by penicillin, which showed both better effects and fewer side effects (sulfonamides can cause kidney stones and changes in bone marrow)."
"When he was five, in 1900, his father was transferred to Sommerfeld (now Lubsko, Poland)."
Gerhard Johannes Paul Domagk (German pronunciation: [ˈɡeːɐ̯haʁt ˈdoːmak] (listen); 30 October 1895 – 24 April 1964) was a German pathologist and bacteriologist.
"In May 1915, he rejoined the eastern front as a medic."
"A novel compound synthesised by Friedrich Mietzsch and Joseph Klarer, a benzene derivative of azo dye attached with sulphonamide group as a side chain was found to have antibacterial activity against human bacterium Streptococcus pyogenes."
"In a notable incidence, Domagk's six-year-old daughter, Hildegarde, injured herself with a stitching needle while making Christmas decorations on 4 December 1935."
"Werner Schulemann, Friedrich Mietzsch, Hans Mauss and Joseph Klarer were largely responsible for providing a continuous supply of chemicals to be screened."
"He took a sabbatical leave for two years without pay, and decided to accept IF Farben's offer in 1929."
"On 17 November, he was arrested by the Gestapo who detained him for a week."
"Later, Ehrlich and his students found that some azo dyes were effective against African sleeping sickness."
"Domagk himself wrote to the NSDAP Office of the Führer, Hitler's headquarters, that should he be allowed to receive he award, he would donate 100,000 Deutsche Marks for the war cause."
The needle was removed at a hospital.
Gross was impressed with him and appointed him a junior doctor at Greifswald.
"== Awards and honours ==
Domagk was awarded the 1939 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine."
"A serious worsening of the general condition and dizziness occurred, so that we were gravely worried about the child."
"In a desperate attempt to save his daughter's arm from amputation and her life, Domagk used the new compound that eventually cured the infection."
"Without other options of treatment, he gave the Streptozon that cured the woman in a couple of days."
There he was given a training as medical orderly.
"He recalled the horrors and suffering, especially of infections, at the battlefields, saying ""There horrible impressions kept pursuing me during my whole life, and made me think how I could take measures against bacteria..."
"While working in the pathology department of the University of Münster, Domagk was invited to join the IG Farben branch at Elberfeld (later Wuppertal) in 1927."
"== Biography ==
Domagk was born in Lagow, Brandenburg, German Empire (now Poland)."
"In 1913, P. Eisenberg discovered that another azo dye, chrysoidine could kill bacteria and could be used as a disinfectant."
"In 1956, he reported the successful development of an anticancer drug which he designated E-39 (E for ethylenimine quinones)."
"We will be satisfied if we ca slow down it growth, in order to preserve the life of a patient longer and under bearable conditions."
"He tested the drug again on another woman with the same result, to which he remarked: ""Almost at once there was a surprising and most gratifying change."""
He was transported to Lichterfelde near Berlin where he recovered from the injury.
"Domagk explained how Zephirol applied to the skin, such as before wearing gloves during surgery, could prevent infection."
"It was officially announced in Berlin that Domagk had ""rather regretfully declined"" the award."
This is still in practice when the infection had caused severe tissue damage even after antibiotics are available.
"At the time, there was no medical cure for streptococcal infection, and infected body parts had to be surgically removed to prevent further spread of the infection."
The drug became the first commercially available antibiotic and marketed under the brand name Prontosil.
"He had an elder brother Erich, who died in childhood, and a younger sister, Charlotte."
"In 1951, he was one of seven Nobel Laureates who attended the 1st Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting."
"However, he found a serious side effect that the surviving mice developed severe kidney damages."
"Two years after the end of World War II and the Nazi regime, the Nobel Foundation gave the Nobel medallion and a diploma to Domagk in 1947."
"In the first experiment, he infected 26 mice by injecting the bacteria, and he injected a single dose of Prontosil to 12 of the infected mice, while the rest 14 were simply kept infected (as controls) without Prontosil treatment."
"Since the end of the 19th century, azo dyes, developed and used for colouring textile and other materials, were found to have medicinal properties against infections."
"Immediately after reading Domagk's paper, in 1935, Colebrook repeated the experiments on mice using both soluble Streptozon and the less soluble form and found that Streptozon was more effective but only in specific bacteria that caused puerperal fever."

"On 9 April 2008, Césaire had serious heart troubles and was admitted to Pierre Zobda Quitman hospital in Fort-de-France."
"In 1941, Aimé Césaire and Suzanne Roussi founded the literary review Tropiques, with the help of other Martinican intellectuals such as René Ménil and Aristide Maugée, in order to challenge the cultural status quo and alienation that characterized Martinican identity at the time."
"Like many left-wing intellectuals in 1930s and 1940s France, Césaire looked toward the Soviet Union as a source of progress, virtue, and human rights."
Césaire traveled to Paris to attend the Lycée Louis-le-Grand on an educational scholarship.
"Césaire compared colonial violence to Nazism, arguing: ""they tolerated that Nazism before it was inflicted on them, they absolved it, shut their eyes to it, legitimized it, because, until then, it had been applied only to non-European peoples."
"Most notably, his relation to Frantz Fanon, famed author of Black Skin, White Masks, as mentor and inspiration is tangible."
"Césaire became a teacher at the Lycée Schoelcher in Fort-de-France, where he taught Frantz Fanon, becoming a great influence for Fanon as both a mentor and contemporary."
"Césaire's many run-ins with censorship did not deter him, however, from being an outspoken defendant of Martinican identity."
"In 1960, he published Toussaint Louverture, based on the life of the Haitian revolutionary."
"Particularly, Césaire argues that Nazism was not an exception or singular event in European history; rather, the natural progression of a civilization that justified colonization without ""perceiving the dangers involved in proceeding towards savagery."""
He was also proclaimed as a national hero in Martinique.
Césaire married fellow Martinican student Suzanne Roussi in 1937.
He later grew disillusioned with the Soviet Union after the 1956 suppression of the Hungarian revolution.
"With the Parti Progressiste Martiniquais, he dominated the island’s political scene for the last half of the century."
"The two had met in 1940, and Breton later would champion Cesaire's work."
"Critiques of French universalism were also apparent in the text, particularly citing the issues that universalism caused for the departmentalization of Martinique of which Césaire was the main propagator."
"""Césaire's wishes for post-war Europe centered around decolonization, arguing that decolonization was the way forward for Europe out of ""the binarism of capitalism/communism."""
"Fanon's personal testimony in Black Skin, White Masks explains the ""liberating effect of Césaire’s word and action"" that he felt in traversing the changing colonial landscape."
Together they moved back to Martinique in 1939 with their young son.
"In 1947, his book-length poem Cahier d'un retour au pays natal, which had first appeared in the Parisian periodical Volontés in 1939 after rejection by a French book publisher, was published."
French President Nicolas Sarkozy was present but did not make a speech.
"A national commemoration ceremony was held on 6 April 2011, as a plaque in Césaire's name was inaugurated in the Panthéon in Paris."
"== Later life ==
In 2006, he refused to meet the leader of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), Nicolas Sarkozy, a probable contender at the time for the 2007 presidential election, because the UMP had voted for the 2005 French law on colonialism."
He managed to get a law addressing departmentalization approved unanimously on 19 March 1946.
"His father was a tax inspector, and his mother was a dressmaker."
"He considered himself of Igbo descent from Nigeria, and considered his first name Aimé a retention of an Igbo name; though the name is of French origin, ultimately from the Old French word amée, meaning beloved, its pronunciation is similar to the Igbo eme, which forms the basis for many Igbo given names."
"In 1934 Césaire was invited to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia by his friend Petar Guberina where in Šibenik he started writing his poem “Notebook of a Return to the Native Land”, which was one of the first expressions of the concept of Négritude."
"He was critical of neo-imperialism and US capitalism, and in many ways his fearful vision of the future has come to fruition today."
Manifestos by these three students in its third number (May–June 1935) initiated the Négritude movement later substantial in both pan-Africanist theory and the actual decolonization of the French Empire in Africa.
"Breton contributed a laudatory introduction to this 1947 edition, saying that the ""poem is nothing less than the greatest lyrical monument of our times."""
He announced his resignation from the PCF in a text entitled Lettre à Maurice Thorez (Letter to Maurice Thorez).
Césaire served as President of the Regional Council of Martinique from 1983 to 1988.
"Césaire declined to renew his mandate as deputy in the National Assembly in 1993, after a 47-year continuous term."
"This law required teachers and textbooks to ""acknowledge and recognize in particular the positive role of the French presence abroad, especially in North Africa"", a law considered by many as a eulogy to colonialism and French actions during the Algerian War."
"""Aimé Césaire""."
"He says that Hitler lives within and is the demon of  ""the very distinguished, very humanistic, very Christian bourgeois of the twentieth century."""
The book mixes poetry and prose to express Césaire's thoughts on the cultural identity of black Africans in a colonial setting.
"Césaire originally wrote his text in French in 1950, but later worked with Joan Pinkham to translate it to English."
"He was ""one of the founders of the Négritude movement in Francophone literature"" and coined the word négritude in French."
"Césaire's text intertwines slavery, imperialism, capitalism, republicanism, and modernism, stating that they were linked together and influenced one another in undeniable ways."
"== World War II ==
The years of World War II were ones of great intellectual activity for the Césaires."
In 1958 Césaire founded the Parti Progressiste Martiniquais.
"Decolonization offered an alternative to the dual negatives of capitalism and communism, employing pluralism as a way to usher in a new, more tolerant Europe."
"He wrote Discours sur le colonialisme (Discourse on Colonialism), a denunciation of European colonial racism, decadence, and hypocrisy that was republished in the French review Présence Africaine in 1955 (English translation 1957)."
His writings during this period reflect his passion for civic and social engagement.
"During an interview granted in 1978, Césaire explains that his aim for including these articles in Tropiques was ""to allow Martinique to refocus"" and ""to lead Martinicans to reflect"" on their close environment."
Official tribute site to Aimé Césaire.
"In Paris, he passed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure in 1935 and created the literary review L'Étudiant noir (The Black Student) with Léopold Sédar Senghor and Léon Damas."
"More generally, Césaire's works conceptualized African unity and black culture in ways that allowed for the creation of black spaces where there previously were none, from the establishment of several literary journals to his reworking of Caliban's speech from Shakespeare's The Tempest."
"Aimé Césaire, by Mabogo Percy More, May 2008."
"The text also continuously references Nazism, blaming the barbarism of colonialism and how whitewashed and accepted the tradition, for Hitler's rise to power."
"Poetically, Césaire's legacy is far-reaching in poetry both from his time and beyond."
"His family moved to the capital of Martinique, Fort-de-France, in order for Césaire to attend the only secondary school on the island, Lycée Victor Schœlcher."
"His works include the book-length poem Cahier d'un retour au pays natal (1939), Une Tempête, a response to Shakespeare's play The Tempest, and Discours sur le colonialisme (Discourse on Colonialism), an essay describing the strife between the colonizers and the colonized."
"This text criticizes the hypocrisy of justifying colonization with the equation ""Christianity=civilized, paganism=savagery"" comparing white colonizers to ""savages""."
President Jacques Chirac finally had the controversial law repealed.
"He also became close to French surrealist poet André Breton, who spent time in Martinique during the war."
"Importantly, all of those oppressive forces came together to hurt the colonized and empower the colonizer."
"== Student, educator and poet ==
Aimé Césaire was born in Basse-Pointe, Martinique, French Caribbean, in 1913."
Departmentalization was an important goal for Césaire both in his texts and in his political career.
"Césaire believed that the only possible redemption for Europe’s dark path which had led to Nazism was through interactions with the ""Third World""."
He was a lower class citizen but still learned to read and write.
"In this sense, according to Ursula Heise, the publications of the French botanist Henri Stehlé in Tropiques in the early 1940's, concerning the Martinican flora, and ""the invocations of Césaire to the Antillean ecology operate as indices of a racial and cultural authenticity which is distinguished from European identity...""."

He made many recordings for Voice of America.
"Though Faith initially mined the worlds of Broadway, Hollywood and Latin music for many of his top-selling 1950s recordings, he enjoyed popularity starting in 1962 with his orchestral versions of popular rock and pop hits of the day."
"With the advent of harder rock sounds in the 1970s, Faith's elegant arrangements fell out of favour with the listening and record-buying public, although he continued to release albums as diverse and contemporary as Jesus Christ Superstar and Black Magic Woman."
The orchestral accordionist John Serry Sr. collaborated with Faith in these broadcasts.
He became a staple of American popular music in the 1950s and continued well into the 1960s.
"Faith remains the only artist to have the best selling single of the year during both the pop singer era (""Song from Moulin Rouge"") and the rock era (""Theme from A Summer Place""); and he is one of only three artists, along with Elvis Presley and The Beatles, to have the best selling single of the year twice."
He was the oldest of eight children.

"With the success of Columbia record-mate Ray Conniff's chorus and orchestra during this same time, Faith began using a chorus (usually all female in most of his recordings, but used a mixed chorus on his albums Leaving on a Jet Plane and I Think I Love You, which were released in 1970 and 1971 respectively) in several popular albums from the mid-1960s on."

"Shortly before the January Uprising, the elite of local Polish youth gathered in his apartment."
"In 1869, he defined the Primorsky Range (1728 m), which stretches along the western shore of Lake Baikal, as an independent morphographic unit."
"The main result of this expedition was the discovery of a huge trap cover (the Middle Siberian Traps), traced by him along the valley of the Lower Tunguska for over 1900 kilometers."
"Accused of participating in the uprising, Czekanowski was arrested and sentenced to indefinite exile in Siberia, whereupon he was sent on foot from Kiev to Tobolsk."
"A new second expedition was hastily prepared, which was to cross the Arctic Circle and conduct research to the still unknown river Olenyok."
"== Awards and honours ==

"Between 1869 and 1871 Chekanovski conducted work on the study of Baikal Mountains and Siberian lands from Baikal to Yenisei and Sayan Mountains, and also studied Irkutsk province."
"After receiving a doctor's diploma in 1855 but without a taste for medicine, the 25-year-old Czekanowski moved to Tartu to study mineralogy for two years."
"After recovering a little from the disease, in 1866 he was exiled to Bratsk where he became interested in the local geology."
"At this time, the academician Fedor Bogdanovich Schmidt, an acquaintance from Tartu, who saved him from this difficult situation."
"The company commissioned him to lead a small research expedition lasting two years, to which Ferdinand Ferdinandovich Miller was appointed to its staff as astronomer and physicist."

"== Biography ==
Aleksander Czekanowski was born on 12 February 1833 in Krzemieniec, Volhynia."
"He was then deported to near Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai in Transbaikalie west of Lake Baikal."
"The first expedition began in March 26 1873 when Czekanowski went from Irkutsk to the source of the Lena, where he studied the geological structure of the banks of the upper reaches of the Lena and Angara rivers."
From there in Verkhoyansk they reached Yakutsk and in January 1875 returned to Irkutsk.
The work was involved frequent trips which gave him the opportunity to conduct scientific research.
While there he also attended lectures on natural science and participated in local field trips during which he developed a strong interest in geology.
"From a barge Czekanowski conducted an investigation of the banks of the Lena from Yakutsk to Bulun exploring the Lena River for a distance of about 1,200 kilometres (750 mi), from Yakutsk to the mouth to the Eyekit, its left tributary."
May 12 the group moved in boats along the Angara River to the headwaters Lower Tunguska.
"From Moyero, the two crossed the hill Bukochan that acts as a low watershed, and crossed to the Oleneok about 150 kilometres below the source, and in July began rafting down on the river on a raft."
"When the ice drift began on the Angara, physicist Miller and the Nakhalny topographer joined him from Irkutsk."
"In the same year, he presented to the Academy of Sciences a project of an expedition in which he set out to geologically explore all the large Siberian rivers in the territory between the Yenisei, Lena, Anabar, Khatanga and Pyasina."
Smolyannikov S.A.
"Shortly after the birth of Alexander, his family moved to Kiev."
It was the second scientific expedition to the Lower Tunguska after Daniel Messerschmidt (1723).
"Czekanowski, having decided that it was the Olenyok, however, the local Evenks explained that it was Moyero (the right tributary of the Kotuya  from the Khatanga basin), and Olenyok was located to the northeast."
"By the 18 September the expedition was already in Bulun, having safely crossed the frozen Lena."
"Czekanowsky, Aleksander in the Nordic Family Book (second edition, 1906)"

"Upon his arrival in Tobolsk, he was sent into exile in Tomsk where he contracted typhoid fever, the consequences of which were periodic mental disorders."
"He hoped to have time to conduct geological exploration of the banks of the Lena River before the onset of winter, but a short summer frustrated his plans."
"In September 1873, the expedition, having passed the Arctic Circle, reached the Yenisei and by November 5 had returned to Irkutsk."
In 1871 together with Wiktor Godlewski and Benedykt Dybowski he explored the northern part of the shore of Lake Khövsgöl in Mongolia.
"Czekanowski established that there are no high mountains along the Olenyok, and according to his definition, the length of the river was about 2350 kilometres (according to the latest data – 2292 kilometers)."

"He bought a collection from Czekanowski and ordered more, as well as providing him with books."
"In addition, Czekanowski's “Additional information to the map of the Lower Tunguska River"" for the first time described the territory along the river as a plateau – a hill with characteristic table mountains."
"Thus ended the three expeditions of A. L. Czekanowski, the zoological results of which were recognized as “the richest of all that have ever been undertaken in Siberia."
"However, the expedition's equipment required large sums of money, and the project of Czekanowski met with serious objections."
"Over the three summer months of 1873, travellers traced the entire course of the Lower Tunguska to its mouth, plotting it on a map and determining its length (2989 km)."
"The journey lasted two months, and finally, in April, the expedition reached the shores Syurungna (Vilyui)."

His father Wawrzyniec ran a boarding house and was an honorary assistant in a zoological office at a high school.
"At first, the path ran along the deep and wide bay of the Eyekit river, and then along the rocky and mountainous watershed area lying between the Lena and the Olenyok and descending along the Kelimyar River to the Olenyok."
From the Kelimyar he traced the course of the Olenyok to its mouth.
His stay in Irkutsk was marked by a number of scientific discoveries that brought him the glory of “one of the outstanding geologists of Russia”.
"Then they returned again to 70º 30` N, ascend one of the right tributaries of Olenyok, crossed watershed and between Olenyok and Lena and descend on the latter to the village of Bulun."

He is survived by his wife and daughter.
"Under his rule, human rights records were extremely poor as most of the pre-war Georgian population of Abkhazia were deprived the right to return, and those who remained were subjected to systematic ethnic cleansing."
"After graduating from the Historical Department of the Sukhumi Pedagogical Institute, Ardzinba studied at the Tbilisi State University where he received a doctoral degree."
"== Early life and career ==
Vladislav Ardzinba was born in the village of Lower Eshera, Sukhumi District, Abkhaz ASSR, Georgian SSR, Soviet Union."
He had not appeared in public since 2002.
"Ardzinba, who was a charismatic but excitable figure popular among the Abkhaz, was believed by Georgians to have helped to instigate the violence of July 1989."
"In mid-1991, he negotiated and accepted the Georgian concession on the reform of the electoral law that granted the Abkhaz wide over-representation in the Supreme Soviet."
"Vladislav Ardzinba (Abkhaz: Владислав Арӡынба, Georgian: ვლადისლავ არძინბა; 14 May 1945 – 4 March 2010) was the first de facto President of Abkhazia."
"He once stated that independence from Georgia is not negotiable, and he has tried to align the state with Russia, whose political and economic support was essential to the republic."
"He then worked for eighteen years in Moscow specialising in ancient Middle Eastern civilizations under Yevgeniy Primakov, then head of the Institute of Oriental Studies in Moscow, and later Russian foreign and Prime Minister."
"However, although the Abkhaz Constitution allows for impeachment, the process would likely have not been completed before the end of his term, so no serious steps were taken to bring it about."
"He won the first direct polls on 3 October 1999, without an opponent and was re-elected as president of Abkhazia."
"Ardzinba managed to consolidate his power relatively quickly and reneged on pre-election promises to increase the representation of Georgians in Abkhazia's autonomous structures; since then, Ardzinba tried to rule Abkhazia relatively single-handedly, but avoided, for the time being, overt conflict with the central authorities in Tbilisi."
"Despite increasing calls from the opposition (particularly the Amtsakhara movement) for him to resign he had stated that he would finish his term, which was supposed to end in October 2004, but in fact did not end until 12 February 2005, due to disputes over the election of his successor."
He had been escorted there the previous week.
He was in the Central Clinical Hospital in Moscow at the time.
"From there, he was involved closely with national issues, including Abkhazia, and quickly emerged as one of the most active proponents of the Abkhaz secessionist cause."
"However, Ardzinba created the Abkhazian National Guard that was mono-ethnically Abkhaz, and initiated a practice of replacing ethnic Georgians in leading positions with Abkhaz."
"He then returned to Sukhumi and he served there as the director of the Abkhazian Institute of Language, Literature and History from 1987 until 1989, when he was elected a Deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union from Gudauta."
"As the Georgian-Abkhaz tensions rose, Ardzinba's rhetoric mounted, as he claimed in late July 1992 that ""Abkhazia is strong enough to fight Georgia."
He installed an autocratic regime and remained politically untouchable until his health seriously deteriorated in 2003.
"They took shelter in Gudauta, a home to the Soviet-era Russian military base."
The cause of death was not released to the public.
He had been in extremely poor health and underwent treatment in Moscow for some time.
During the last years of his presidency Ardzinba faced criticism for both failing to bring stability to Abkhazia and his increasingly low public profile.
"The President of Abkhazia, Sergei Bagapsh, paid tribute: ""His service to the Abkhaz people was boundless""."

In 1955 a French postal stamp commemorated him."
"In 1806 Appert presented a selection of bottled fruits and vegetables from his manufacture at the Exposition des produits de l'industrie française, but did not win any reward."
"== Later life ==
Despite the government grant, Appert's financial situation did not improve and was exacerbated by the destruction of his factory at Massy by Prussian and Austrian forces at the end of the War of the Sixth Coalition in 1814."
A room in the Musée des Beaux-Arts et d'Archéologie de Châlons-en-Champagne was dedicated to him.
"He declared bankruptcy in 1806, but was able to continue his business."
"Cans were exported to Bavaria and Saint Petersburg, and received praise from newspapers across France."
Appert was a confectioner and chef in Paris from 1784 to 1795.
"The bottle was then wrapped in canvas to protect it, dunked into boiling water, and boiled for as much time as Appert deemed appropriate for cooking the contents thoroughly."
"In 1810, British inventor and merchant Peter Durand patented his own method, but this time in a tin can, thus creating the modern-day process of canning foods."
Since 1962 this association has focused on improving courses related to food technology education and organises several events each year for students and alumni.
"In 1810 the Bureau of Arts and Manufactures of the Ministry of the Interior gave Appert an ex gratia payment of 12,000 francs on condition that he make his process public."
"He left air space at the top of the bottle, and the cork would then be sealed firmly in the jar by using a vise."

Appert then established a business to preserve a variety of food in sealed bottles.
The Principality of Monaco issued a postage stamp featuring Appert.
"However, he fell under suspicion during the subsequent Reign of Terror and was arrested in April 1794, but he was able to avoid being executed himself."

"In 1985 a street in Paris, the Rue Nicolas-Appert, was constructed and named in his honour."
"== Early life ==

"== Study association ==
The student association of the Food Technology education at Wageningen University is called Nicolas Appert."

"His family ran an inn in the town and he worked in the family business until the age of twenty, when he opened a brewery with one of his brothers."
"During this period, he married Elisabeth Benoist and the couple had four children."
"Nicolas Appert (17 November 1749 – 1 June 1841) was a French confectioner and inventor who, in the early 19th century, invented airtight food preservation."

Many other streets in France bear his name.
"In honor of Appert, canning is sometimes called ""appertization"", which is distinct from pasteurization."
"Despite his technical successes, Appert had financial troubles due to the high cost of his equipment and the fact that he was not a very good businessman."
"In 1795, he began experimenting with ways to preserve foodstuffs, succeeding with soups, vegetables, juices, dairy products, jellies, jams, and syrups."
This was the first book of its kind on modern food preservation methods.
"In 1795, the French army had offered a prize of 12,000 francs for a new method to preserve food."

"He then served as head chef to Christian IV, Count Palatine of Zweibrücken for thirteen years."
"Despite silver and gold medals from the Société d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale in 1816 and 1820 respectively, it was not until 1824 that he received the 2,000 francs associated with them."
"He placed the food in glass jars, sealed them with cork and sealing wax and placed them in boiling water (in later years, he switched to using an autoclave)."
"He petitioned Louis Philippe I for entry into the Legion of Honour but was denied, possibly due to his activities during the Revolution."
"Taking this as an insult, he retired in 1836 at the age of 86."

Umegatani won 116 bouts and lost only 6 bouts in the top makuuchi division."
"After some time, he joined Minato stable and changed his ring name to Umegatani (梅ヶ谷) in honor of his hometown, Umegaya in Shiwa Village."
"Umegaya, however, remained calm and stayed in the prefecture to play an active role in pacifying the conflict."
"== Career ==
His real name was Oe Tōtarō (小江 藤太郎)."
"After his retirement, he served for a long time as a director in the Tokyo Sumo Association under the elder name of Ikazuchi."
A myth attributes to him the great consumption of sake instead of mother's milk.
"Umegatani lived until the age of eighty-three, making him the longest-lived yokozuna of all time."
"Having deserted Osaka-sumo, he became very unpopular with the rikishi of this association."
"He outlived Umegatani Totaro II by nine months, and is one of very few yokozuna to have died of old age."
"The Association however gave him the honorary title ""Ōrai"" (大雷, 'Great Thunderbolt') and treated him as an advisor."
"Between 1876 and 1881, Umegatani started a period of dominance over Tokyo-sumo, winning 58 consecutive bouts, a streak only stopped once when he lost to then sekiwake Wakashima."
"It is said that when asked by a potential backer what he had in the way of collateral, simply showing his muscles was enough to clinch the deal."
"This streak is the fourth best record of consecutive victories behind Futabayama, Tanikaze and Hakuhō."
"After his promotion, he was given a set of three keshō-mawashi by Itō Hirobumi."
"He achieved a winning average of 95.1, the highest record among yokozuna, though could not surpass ōzeki Raiden."
"When Umegatani II retired during the June 1915 tournament, Umegatani I transmited his stable and his elder name to him."
"From around the age of 12, he attended a temple school and began to wrestle, and by the time he was 16, he was known as ""Chikuzen Muteki"" (筑前無敵, 'invincible')."
Umegatani felt he wasn't content with the rank and so gave it up.
"== Yokozuna ==
In February 1884, Umegaya received a yokozuna license from both the Yoshida (Tokyo-sumo) and Gojō (Osaka-sumo) families."
"He transferred to Tokyo-sumo in December 1870, and began his career over again from the bottom of the rankings."
"There, he was recruited into Tamagaki stable."
"During his coaching career, he raised yokozuna Umegatani Tōtarō II, who later became his son-in-law."
"At 16, he was taken in by the Osaka Sumo Association and took the shikona, or ring name, Umegae (梅ヶ枝)."
"In 1876, while performing in Fukuoka Prefecture, he encountered rebels, which resulted in a brawl between wrestlers and rebels."
"However, no one in Osaka could rival him and, in the joint tournament of December 1874, he won eight matches in a row and claimed the championship."
"Umegatani preferred the Yoshida license, which is said to have determined the outcome of the competition between the Yoshida and Gojō families' struggle for dominance in the sumo world."
He was the sport's 15th yokozuna.
Umegatani was not a particularly large wrestler but was remarkably strong and reached the rank of ōzeki in Osaka-sumo.
He helped to raise funds for the building of the first Ryōgoku Kokugikan stadium in 1909.
"At the request of the Emperor Meiji, he was permitted to perform his ring-entering ceremony and fight in front of the emperor."

René Thury (7 August 1860  –  23 April 1938) was a Swiss pioneer in electrical engineering.
This was a challenge for all DC systems because the induction principle used in the step down transformers pioneered by Lucien Gaulard and ZBD in the early 1880s only worked with AC.
"Back in Geneva, he directed the fabrication under SIP license of Edison and Gramme dynamos."
"Placing loads in series means that since current must flow through each device to get to the next, if the circuit is broken in any of the devices, the current stops at all other loads."
Retrieved 3 June 2017.
"When Bürgin left SIP in 1876, Thury became his successor."
"Thury solved the problems of commutation and built the first dynamo with voltages of up to 25,000 volts."
"In 1877, he built a steam powered tricycle along with a medical student Jean-Jacques Nussberger who financed the project."
Attention was turned to conversion of DC to lower voltages that was more efficient and less cumbersome that mechanically driving smaller generators as in the Sampierdarena Railway station example.
"He gained many insights, but also came to the conclusion that Edison's Dynamos could be significantly improved."

"== Early and personal life ==
Maloney was born on September 6, 1961, in Jackson, Mississippi."
"In 18 seasons (1991–96; 1998–2009) as a manager, his teams have won 1,191 games and lost 1,121 (.515) with two league championships—including the 2009 PCL playoff title."
"He was nicknamed ""The Hammer"" and ""Wally Pipp"" during his MSU playing days for his smooth stroke and for being the starting first baseman on State's 1983 squad before contracting a stomach virus early in that campaign."
He served as a professor of higher analysis and Director of the Mathematics Institute.
They served in the trenches and many of them were lost during the war.
After completing high-school Fréchet was required to enroll in military service.
"Despite his major achievements, Fréchet was not overly appreciated in France."
"He also made several important contributions to the field of statistics and probability, as well as calculus."
He was mobilised on 4 August the same year.
In 1929 he became foreign member of the Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences and in 1950 foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.
This is the time when he was deciding whether to study mathematics or physics – he chose mathematics out of dislike of the chemistry classes he would have had to take otherwise.
His dissertation opened the entire field of functionals on metric spaces and introduced the notion of compactness.
Maurice attended the secondary school Lycée Buffon in Paris where he was taught mathematics by Jacques Hadamard.
Fréchet was promoted to tenured Chair of General Mathematics in 1933 and to Chair of Differential and Integral Calculus in 1935.
"In 1941 Fréchet succeeded Borel as chair in the Calculus of Probabilities and Mathematical Physics, a position Fréchet held until he retired in 1949."
"Because of his diverse language skills, gained when his mother ran the establishment for foreigners, he served as an interpreter for the British Army."
"Independently of Riesz, he discovered the representation theorem in the space of Lebesgue square integrable functions."
"As a result, his father lost his job."
"=== Middle life ===
Fréchet served at many different institutions during his academic career."
"From 1907 to 1908 he served as a professor of mathematics at the Lycée in Besançon, then moved in 1908 to the Lycée in Nantes to stay there for a year."
"As an illustration, while being nominated numerous times, he was not elected a member of the Académie des sciences until the age of 78."
"After Hadamard moved to the University of Bordeaux in 1894, Hadamard continuously wrote to Fréchet, setting him mathematical problems and harshly criticising his errors."
"However, this was not a safe job; he spent two and a half years very near to or at the front."
"Fréchet was an Esperantist, publishing some papers and articles in that constructed language."
"However, the newly established Third Republic was not sympathetic to religious education and so laws were enacted requiring all education to be secular."
Hadamard recognised the potential of young Maurice and decided to tutor him on an individual basis.
Fréchet briefly held a position of lecturer at the Sorbonne's Rockefeller Foundation and from 1928 was a Professor (without a chair).
"Here Fréchet introduced the concept of a metric space, although the name is due to Hausdorff."
"At the time of his birth, his father was a director of a Protestant orphanage in Maligny and was later in his youth appointed a head of a Protestant school."
French egalitarian ideals caused many academics to be mobilised.
To generate some income his mother set up a boarding house for foreigners in Paris.
"He started publishing quite early, having published four papers in 1903."
"=== First World War ===
Fréchet was planning to spend a year in the United States at the University of Illinois, but his plan was disrupted when the First World War broke out in 1914."
"In 1928 Fréchet decided to move back to Paris, thanks to encouragement from Borel, who was then chair in the Calculus of Probabilities and Mathematical Physics at the Sorbonne."
"== Main works ==
His first major work was his outstanding 1906 PhD thesis Sur quelques points du calcul fonctionnel, on the calculus of functionals."
He made major contributions to general topology and was the first to define metric spaces.

Highlights of the 1978-79 season of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra include the world premiere of Van Dijk's The Shadowmaker (1977)  under the direction of Mario Bernardi  and featuring Canadian baritone Victor Braun.
"Yet, as in every single composition by van Dijk, tonal references are present here as well, demonstrating a kinship not only with Berg, but also with Britten, Henze, Tippett and Martin; all of them composers who have not simply exploited the resources available to them, but rather were grateful ‘inhabitants’ of a rich and saturated musical landscape."
"He married Jeanne Koning and they moved to Ontario, Canada."
"MacEwan has something in common with Strindberg and D.H. Lawrence, as an explorer of these dark corners of the soul that most of us shut out conveniently, in order to create a safe but illusory reality."""
The discriminating ear that makes Van Dijk's orchestral music at once beguiling and immediately recognisable as a personal expression is also to be discerned on the smaller sound-scale of his chamber compositions.
"Later that year, he was engaged by the Canadian Army to join the Canadian Grenadier Guards Band as an oboist."
"What can be said is that he has, with unusual success, blended an emotional intensity at times evocative of the world of Austro-German expressionism with a fascinating subtlety and indirectness of utterance suggestive rather of French affinities."
"Van Dijk lived to attend all three performances at the World premiere of Kreitens Passion in the Tonhalle Düsseldorf performed by the Düsseldorfer Symphoniker, baritone Andreas Schmidt,  and the American conductor John Fiore in October 2003."
"The Piano Concerto (1994) was given its world premiere on May 22, 1996, by the North Netherlands Symphony Orchestra with Australian pianist Geoffrey Douglas Madge conducted by Viktor Liberman."
"In all Van Dijk's music, whichever of his stylistic trends it seems immediately to favour, the voice of a highly original creator is to be heard."
Kreiten was condemned to death and executed by hanging at the Plötzensee prison in Berlin in 1943.
It would be a bold annotator who ventured to pin Van Dijk's artistic origins down to one or other national or stylistic source.
The work plays on a cross-cultural edge and explores valuable territory.
"Sources, as Béla Bartók noted, are much less important in framing a composer's achievement than the use he makes of them."
It received its broadcast from the National Concert Hall in Dublin with the RTÉ National Symphony Orchestra conducted by Colman Pearce on Raidió Teilifís Éireann.
"It has been played numerous times in Canada, Finland, and the United States."
"Maarten Brandt notes ""Van Dijk’s brilliant Piano Concerto (also known as three Pieces for Piano and Orchestra) written for Bernard Jacobson, in which the melodic aspect is always primary and as a rule the harmony quickened by a pleasing melos."
"In 2002, Van Dijk was commissioned by the Düsseldorfer Symphoniker to write a large-scale work for baritone, full choir and orchestra to commemorate the German/Dutch pianist Karlrobert Kreiten."
This relationship would later culminate in the World premiere of his Four Epigrams for Symphony Orchestra (1962) with the CBC Symphony conducted by Walter Susskind as part of the CBC's National School Broadcast series Finding Out about Music.
"In 1944, he took up preparatory piano studies with Corrie Vierdag  at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague."

"The poetry attempts, it seems to me, to lift the veil of 'Maya' (illusion)."
"Maarten Brandt writes: ""The Triple Hymn is a vibrant dance duet."
"The French flautist Jean-Pierre Rampal wrote in a letter to Van Dijk, ""It is a very well constructed work and remarkably written for the flute."""
"In 2000,  classical Indian Bharatanatyam dancer Mayuri Boonham  commissioned Van Dijk The Triple Hymn based on a mantra from the Vedic literature to be performed on a UK tour and at the Spring Loaded Festival at the Place Theatre in London."
Van Dijk returned with his family to Canada and was appointed teacher of piano at the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto.
"His Concertante for Flute, Harp, Percussion and Strings (1963) had its World Premiere at the Royal Alexandra Theatre in Toronto with the Toronto Chamber Orchestra and was televised live on CBC television in January 1964."
"On the day of her death, Van Dijk began composing a violin concerto in her memory."
The work was set to a book of poems called The Shadowmaker written in 1969 by the Canadian poet Gwendolyn MacEwan.
"The biographer of MacEwan, Rosemary Sullivan, quotes Van Dijk in her book: ""What attracted me to the poetry was the substance behind the subject matter - namely the dream."
Van Dijk came to the fore as a composer when his Sonatina for piano was chosen and performed at the International Gaudeamus Music week in 1953.
Is our sensuous experience reality or illusion?
"During this time, he concluded his piano studies with Kendall Taylor in London."
"The music is written for cello, soprano, midrangam, tubular bell and gong, depicting a three-part manifestation of the Goddesses Gayatri, Savitri, and Sarasvati."
"From time to time, the analyst with a taste for such trouvailles may detect what seem like 12-note series in Van Dijk's writing; but these are the incidental consequence of his avoidance of casual note-repetition, and they are never exploited in systematic serial manner."

"In 1732, Goldbach returned to the St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences and stayed in the Russian government when Anna moved the court back to St. Petersburg."
He studied at the Royal Albertus University.
"Goldbach wrote to the president-designate of the academy, petitioning for a position in the academy, using his past publications and knowledge in medicine and law as qualifications."
"After finishing his studies he went on long educational voyages from 1710 to 1724 through Europe, visiting other German states, England, The Netherlands, Italy, and France, meeting with many famous mathematicians, such as Gottfried Leibniz, Leonhard Euler, and Nicholas I Bernoulli."
Goldbach's earlier mathematical work and ideas in letters to Euler directly influenced some of Euler's work.
Goldbach was then hired to a five-year contract as a professor of mathematics and historian of the academy.
Goldbach and Euler's friendship survived Goldbach's move to Moscow in 1728 and communication ensued.
"In 1729, Euler solved two problems pertaining to sequences which had stumped Goldbach."
"In 1742 he entered the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stepping way from the academy once more."
"However, he relinquished duties in the Academy in 1742 and worked in the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs until his death in 1764."
"Goldbach worked with famous mathematicians like Leonhard Euler, Daniel Bernoulli, Johann Bernoulli, and Jean le Rond d'Alembert."
"He also studied and proved some theorems on perfect powers, such as the Goldbach–Euler theorem, and made several notable contributions to analysis."
Christian Wolff had invited and had written recommendations for all the Germans who traveled to Saint Petersburg for the academy except Goldbach.
"Peter II moved the Russian court from St. Petersburg to Moscow in 1729, so Goldbach followed him to Moscow."
"Upon Peter II's death in 1730, Goldbach stopped teaching but continued to assist Empress Anna."
"After traveling around Europe in his early life, he landed in Russia in 1725 as a professor at the newly founded Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences."
"Euler proceeded to write 560 writings, published posthumously in four volumes of Opera omnia, with Goldbach's influence guiding some of the writings."
"Then, in 1737, Goldbach and J.D. Schumacher took over the administration of the academy."
Goldbach was the leading influence on Euler's interest and work in number theory.
Most of the letters discuss Euler's research in number theory as well as differential calculus.
These acquaintances started Goldbach's interest in mathematics.
"As historian of the academy, he recorded each academy meeting from the opening of the school in 1725 until January 1728."
"With Goldbach's return, his friend Euler continued his teaching and research at the academy as well."
He managed to retain his influence in court after the death of Anna and the rule of Empress Elizabeth.
"Goldbach, through his letters, kept Euler focused on number theory in the 1730's by discussing Fermat's conjecture with Euler."
"In 1760, Goldbach created new guidelines for the education of the royal children which would remain for 100 years."
Goldbach was gifted land and increased salary for his good work and rise in the Russian government.
Goldbach jointly led the Academy in 1737.
"These letters spanned a wide range of topics, including various mathematics topics."
"Also, in 1729 Goldbach closely approximated the Basel problem, which prompted Euler's interest and concurring breakthrough solution."
"Also, Goldbach took on duty in Russian court under Empress Anna."
"Also, Goldbach's travels fostered his interest in philology, archaeology, metaphysics, ballistics, and medicine."
"Upon return to the academy, Goldbach was named corresponding secretary."
He is remembered today for Goldbach's conjecture and the Goldbach–Euler Theorem.
"Goldbach started a correspondence with Euler in 1729, in which some of Goldbach's most important mathematics contributions can be found."
"Their correspondence spanned 196 letters over 35 years written in Latin, German, and French."
"Euler subsequently offered a proof to the conjecture, crediting Goldbach with introducing him to the subfield."
"He briefly attended Oxford University in 1713 and, while he was there, Goldbach learned mathematics from mathematical scholars John Wallis and Isaac Newton."
"Between 1717 and 1724, Goldbach published his first few papers which, while minor, credited his mathematical ability."
"Ensuingly, Euler outlined the solutions to Goldbach."

Bogusław died in exile in Königsberg in Brandenburg-Prussia.
By birth he was an Imperial Prince of the Holy Roman Empire.
"== Biography ==
Born of the mightiest and highest resident family of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (as well as a blood descendant of King Casimir IV of Poland, and Kęstutis and Vytautas, monarchs of Lithuania), Radziwiłł was the owner of Biržai, Dubingiai, Słuck, and Kopyta, the great Standard-bearer of Lithuania since 1638, the Master of the Stables of Lithuania since 1648, and the Starost of Bar."
"In the Battle of Prostki on 8 October 1656, Bogusław's forces were decimated by the Commonwealth forces under Hetman Wincenty Korwin Gosiewski."
"Together with his cousin Janusz Radziwiłł in 1654 during The Deluge, or Swedish invasion of Poland, Bogusław Radziwiłł began negotiations with King Charles X Gustav of Sweden aimed at breaking the Commonwealth and the Polish–Lithuanian union."
He was of the Radziwiłł magnate family.
"He was a descendant of the famous knight, Zawisza the Black."
"The former died at Tykocin Castle besieged by forces loyal to the Commonwealth, while Bogusław retreated with his forces to Prussia, where he supported Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg, against the Polish king."
"Boguslaw married Anna Maria Radziwiłł, the only daughter of his relative and collaborator, the late prince Janusz."
"In turn, this couple had only one surviving child, a daughter, Ludwika Karolina Radziwiłł."
"Bogusław Radziwiłł (Lithuanian: Boguslavas Radvila; 3 May 1620 – 31 December 1669) was a Polish princely magnate and a member of the Polish-Lithuanian szlachta, or nobility."
"In Poland it is believed that Bogusław's and Janusz's only lasting achievement was to tarnish the Radziwiłł family name for years to come with their treason, eclipsing the deeds of other Radziwiłłs like Michał Kazimierz Radziwiłł, who fought for the Crown and the Commonwealth against the Swedes."
The Swedish defeat and eventual retreat from the territories of the Commonwealth abruptly ended the plans of Janusz and Bogusław.
He was the last Calvinist male member of his family.

"Between 1990 and 1999, he made a handful of movies, but most of them were either shelved or made no impression."
Mehmood had an elder sister and six younger siblings.
"He later had a number of odd jobs, selling poultry products and working as a driver for director P. L. Santoshi."
"He later went on to act in lead roles as well, but he was more appreciated for his comedy, some of which was in the Hyderabad region's Urdu accent."
Mehmood later on in an interview said that he has forgiven Amitabh.
"He was the second of the eight children, and eldest son to Latifunnisa and film and stage actor/dancer Mumtaz Ali, who was a huge star of the 1940s and 1950s cinema in Bombay."

In 1944 Richard Acland donated the ancestral estate of Killerton to the National Trust.
Acland was also a clinical anatomist and became a pioneer in the field of fresh tissue dissection.
Acland played a key role in the founding of the University of Louisville’s fresh tissue dissection laboratory in 1981.
"Robert D. Acland, MBBS, FRCS  (June 20, 1941 – January 6, 2016) was a surgeon and academic credited with being one of the pioneers in plastic and reconstructive microsurgery."
"""Robert Acland grew up in the dower house at Killerton instead of the main manor house."
"He died on January 6, 2016, some 16 months later."
"Acland realized that he needed to commercialize the process and initially approached Ethicon, then the largest suture manufacturer in Britain, with a proposal to do so."
"== Career ==
While at Canniesburn Hospital, Acland performed meticulous microsurgery operations that could last up to 14 hours."
During his training in Swindon he began developing microsurgical instruments on the side but realized that to make any real progress he would need to research the problem full-time.
They thought microsurgery sutures would not sell well and turned him down.
"In 1992 he married Bette Levy, a respected local textile artist, to whom he was married until his death in 2016."
"With this funding he returned to London Hospital in 1970, where he improved the tiny needles and thread used in microsurgery, invented the ""Acland micro vessel clamp,"" and investigated how to prevent microthrombosis."
"== Early life and education ==
Robert Acland was born on June 20, 1941, in Exeter, England, to Richard Thomas Dyke Acland, the 15th baronet of Columb John, and Anne Alford."
Acland started at London Hospital Medical College (now Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry) in 1959.
"He went to the village school and then to Bryanston School in Dorset, where he said he developed ""a great interest in breaking rules."""
"A retired surgeon, Herbert Wald, asked Acland and two other surgeons, Harold Kleinert and Gordon Tobin, to help pay for a large walk-in refrigerator for unembalmed cadaver preservation."
"He realized that the fellowship needed to improve its teaching of microsurgery, and invited Acland to set up a teaching laboratory at the suggestion of Graham Lister, a plastic surgeon who had joined Kleinert's practice and who had trained with Acland at Canniesburn Hospital."
"He married his first wife, Sarah Wood, in 1963."
"A fellow student at the London Hospital Medical College, she became a psychiatrist and accompanied him when he moved to the United States in 1975."
His goal in producing the video atlas was to dissect lightly embalmed cadavers in order to preserve natural tissue appearance and demonstrate structures moving as they would in the living body.
"Although he had been considering such a project for years, the immediate cause was a conversation he had with a medical student, Suzanne l'Ecuyer, at the University of Louisville, after giving a lecture on the importance of anatomy in clinical practice."
"Acland was appointed director of the fresh tissue laboratory in 1983 upon Dr. Wald's full retirement, and under his leadership the laboratory was substantially expanded and improved."
This experience heightened his interest in surgery and made him feel like he could use his hands to help people.
"=== Acland's Video Atlas of Human Anatomy ===
Acland began making a video atlas of anatomy in the fall of 1993."
"He published the first edition of Acland's Practice Manual for Micro-vascular Surgery, also known as the ""Red Book"", a manual on microsurgical techniques (1997)."
The video atlas depicts moving structures and pioneers new and highly effective techniques of anatomical videography for a clear three-dimensional understanding of spatial relationships.
"He had two children with her; Benjamin, born in 1985, and Emily, born in 1987."
"Although Richard Acland was a member of the landed gentry, he held left-wing political views; he was a Labour member of Parliament (MP) and one of the founders of the far-left Common Wealth Party, which promoted common ownership of land."
"The center had been founded by Harold E. Kleinert, a pioneering surgeon who was the first to use microsurgery to treat hand injuries, and his partner and fellow hand surgeon Joseph E. Kutz."
"== Personal life ==
Acland was married three times and had four children."
"In 1969 Acland spent a year as a senior registrar in general surgery in Swindon, where his interest in microsurgery began after watching John Cobett perform a microvascular anastomosis."
"In 1975 he accepted an offer to set up a microsurgery teaching laboratory at the Kleinert-Kutz Hand Center in Louisville, Kentucky."
"Acland was fascinated by the utmost surgical skill microsurgery required, and thought that the instrumentation then available was crude and could be improved upon."
"Acland then turned to Springler and Tritt, a startup suture company in southern Germany."
"== Illness and death ==
Acland was diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma, or bile duct cancer, in September 2014."
"As they would not be able to rely on Killerton for financial support, Richard Acland told his sons that they would have to ""make it on their own by being better, not by heredity."
"Owned by the Aclands since the 17th century, Killerton consisted of a manor house and several thousand acres near Exeter."
"After graduating in 1964, he did an internship at Bukumbi Hospital in Tanzania, where he built a Thomas splint (fraction splint) for a boy mauled by a lion."
Acland applied for and received two years of funding from the Medical Research Council (MRC) to improve the instruments used in microsurgery.
"He developed smaller needles and thread for microsurgery, making them himself."
"He divorced Sarah in 1983 and that same year married Susan Bishop of Louisville, Kentucky."
"It was unusual for surgical trainees to receive MRC funding, and Acland suspected that the Scottish plastic surgeon Thomas Gibson may have played a part in approving his application."
He also wanted to help students understand three-dimensional anatomical relationships by rotating the camera around specimens.
"He had the opportunity to learn carpentry and welding at Bryanston, practical skills that he would later put to use as a surgeon."
"Acland continued his medical training as a senior house officer (SHO) in Northampton, Mansfield and then took a SHO post in Oxford."
"In his youth, he had been on the books of Notts County."
He made his test debut in Australia the following winter.
By the end of 1981 he had played six Tests but not been given an extended run in the side and had had limited success.
"The ban having been served, he was recalled into the England squad for the third Test against India in 1986, but had to pull out through injury, and was replaced by Mark Benson."
"County bowlers such as Jonathan Agnew spoke of being ""Nedded"" when he performed well against them."
"In the latter, Larkins top-scored but still finished on the losing side as Richard Hadlee engineered an unlikely successful run chase for Nottinghamshire."
"Wisden observed that Larkins' ""strokeplay"" on this occasion was ""both powerful and subtle."
He decided the following winter to join the first rebel tour of South Africa alongside Gooch and Boycott.
"This gamble paid off in the semi-final where England beat New Zealand narrowly, but failed in the final, where England lost to the West Indies and Larkins had a miserable match."
"=== Legacy ===
Although a talented player, Larkins is considered as something of an underachiever at the top level."
He was selected to play for England as Graham Gooch's opening partner on tours of Australia and the West Indies.
"He moved to first-class newcomers Durham in 1992, retiring from the first-class game in 1995."
"His previous highest in a one-day international was 34 in 1979-80: now he dominated an opening stand of 185 with Gooch, hit two sixes and nineteen fours in his 124, and justified his recall to the England team after an absence of eight years""."
"Wayne Larkins (born 22 November 1953) is an English former cricketer, who represented Northamptonshire, Durham and Bedfordshire as an opening batsman throughout his career."
"In his first Test match back, eight and a half years since his last Test, against the West Indies he opened alongside Gooch and to Larkins fell the honour of scoring the winning run as England beat the West Indies in a Test match for the first time in sixteen years."
"As England progressed through the tournament they decided to gamble on lengthening their batting line up by bringing in Larkins instead of a specialist bowler or allrounder such as Geoff Miller or Phil Edmonds, meaning that according to competition rules, Larkins, Graham Gooch and Geoff Boycott, all part-time bowlers, would probably have to bowl 12 overs between them a match."
"== Football ==
Outside cricket, he was a keen footballer."
Ironically this opportunity was created by rival batters being suspended due to a further rebel tour.
"He scored 27,142 first-class runs in 482 matches, with 59 centuries and a highest score of 252."
"=== International career ===
Larkins first achieved England recognition during the 1979 Cricket World Cup."
"== Mortgage controversy ==
In October 2006, Larkins pleaded guilty to attempting to illegally obtain a mortgage secured against the house of his girlfriend's sick father."
"With his girlfriend Deborah Lines, he bought a home in France."
This meant that he was banned from international cricket for three years.
"In fact he did not get another chance until 1989-90, ten years after his international debut."
"He was part of the unlucky Northamptonshire side narrowly defeated in the final of both major domestic knock-out tournaments in 1987, the Benson & Hedges Cup and the NatWest Trophy."
== References ==
"He was a strong force in domestic one-day cricket, playing 485 matches and scoring 13,594 runs with 26 hundreds."
"In his second game back he played his best international innings and only international century, in a one day international victory over Allan Border's Australia, in the process winning the man of the match award."
"The cricket correspondent, Colin Bateman, opined, ""Larkins was usually ignored when he should have been selected and selected when he should have been ignored in a career of unfulfilled potential."
Initially he was recalled for the Nehru Cup of 1989-90.
"In 2010 he tied for 1st–2nd with IM Oliver Barbosa in the 1st ASEAN Chess Championship in Singapore, and won the event on tie-break."
"Both grandmasters were fighting for the lead, and the encounter had huge sporting significance."
"There are conflicting claims about the exact nature of said scuffle: a press release from the Olympiad organizers placed the blame squarely on Azmaiparashvili's shoulders, saying that after he had tried to gain admittance to the stage on several occasions he ""without any previous provocation, assaulted the agent with a head butt to his mouth""."
"In an ending that was favourable to him, Azmai[parashvili] picked up the bishop, intending to make a move with it instead of first exchanging rooks."
Zurab Azmaiparashvili (Georgian: ზურაბ აზმაიფარაშვილი; born 16 March 1960) is a chess grandmaster from Georgia.
"He came into conflict with security officials, and a scuffle broke out resulting in injuries both to Azmaiparashvili and a security agent."
"Azmaiparashvili was due to appear in court on 22 July 2005, but all charges were dropped shortly beforehand."
"The attitude of the event's organizers towards Azmaiparashvili had apparently been soured when, upon his arrival in Spain, he had attempted to secure himself two hotel rooms, claiming he was entitled to one in his capacity as a FIDE vice-president, and another as a player at the event."
"== Controversies ==
Azmaiparashvili was alleged to have rigged the results of the Strumica tournament of 1995 to boost his rating."
"At the Chess World Cup 2017, where Azmaiparashvili was organizer, he berated player Anton Kovalyov for wearing shorts, racially abusing him with the slur ""gypsy"" and demanding that Kovalyov change ten minutes before his scheduled third-round game, leading to Kovalyov withdrawing from the tournament in response."
"== Career ==
Azmaiparashvili became a Grandmaster in 1988."
"In 2003, Sveshnikov referred to the Azmaiparashvili incident and similar case involving Alexandru Crisan as ""open secrets"", at a time when both purported culprits were heavily involved in FIDE politics."
"The tournament, in which he played 18 rounds against significantly weaker opponents, is generally regarded as an illegitimate event."
"In winning the 2003 European Championship in Istanbul, Azmaiparashvili retracted a move against Vladimir Malakhov (who subsequently finished second)."
Azmaiparashvili is active in chess politics.
"By retracting his blunder and playing a sensible move, Azmaiparashvili won the game and the tournament."
"When we signed the score sheets, Azmai suggested to me that we consider the game a draw."
"This sour mood seems to have brought him extra attention at the closing ceremony when he approached the stage, apparently in an attempt to inform FIDE officials that the organizers had neglected to award a prize named in honour of Georgian former Women's World Champion Nona Gaprindashvili."
"Azmaiparashvili had been criticized earlier in 2004 over arrangements for the 2004 Women's World Chess Championship when female Georgian players Lela Javakhishvili and Ana Matnadze accused him of behaving ""in a hostile and intimidating manner, using inappropriate and vulgar language and bringing to tears our mothers""."
"Among his achievements are a 2810 performance rating at the 1998 Chess Olympiad and first-place finishes at Pavlodar 1982, Moscow 1986, Albena 1986, Tbilisi 1986, London (Lloyds Bank Open) 1989, and in the 2003 European Individual Chess Championship in Silivri."
"FIDE, on the other hand, blamed over-zealous policing, saying in their press release that ""Despite his clear VIP identification, he was severely beaten up by several security guards""."
"Azmaiparashvili received heavy backlash from the global chess community for this incident, including a condemnation from the Association of Chess Professionals and calls from other players demanding that he be removed from his organization roles."
Daria Andreyevna Vaskina (Russian: Дарья Андреевна Васкина; born 30 July 2002) is a Russian swimmer.
"In July 2006, at his home in McLean, Virginia, Lash was involved in a domestic incident with his wife, which resulted in her leaving the house and calling the police."
"Lash was born in Jersey City, New Jersey and grew up in Rahway, New Jersey."
"He told BBC Radio 4's The Film Programme that he ""did not feel good"" about suggesting that Americans, rather than the British, had captured the naval Enigma cipher: ""It was a distortion ... a mercenary decision ... to create this parallel history in order to drive the film for an American audience."
"Both my grandparents were officers in the Second World War, and I would be personally offended if somebody distorted their achievements."

"That was helped by his commanding display in the final against the Philippines, outplaying his counterpart and fellow All-Star Jayson Castro to lead his team in scoring 19 points and grabbing 6 rebounds."

"=== Pumas ===
During the 2016 Currie Cup qualification series, the Nelspruit-based Pumas announced the signing of Lewis, along with fellow Western Province player Devon Williams."
"At the start of 2013, Lewis played Varsity Cup rugby with the Maties, the university side from Lewis' hometown of Stellenbosch."
"He scored another against UFS Shimlas a week later, and a third against Western Cape rivals UCT Ikey Tigers."
His eight tries – the second-most by a Western Province player behind Justin Geduld and fourth overall in Group A of the competition – helped Western Province finish top of the log with ten wins in twelve matches.
"He scored a total of six tries – two in their 90–0 victory over Border U21 in East London, one against the Golden Lions and in the return match against Border in Cape Town, and another two against the Leopards in Potchefstroom – to help Western Province finish top of the log with just one defeat."
Western Province finished top of the log to qualify for the play-offs and Lewis came on for the final few minutes of normal time in their semi-final match against the Golden Lions.

He made three starts and an appearance off the bench during a regular season that saw Maties win all seven of their matches to finish top of the log.
"He scored his first senior try a week later in a 7–25 defeat to the Sharks XV, following that up with tries against the Eastern Province Kings and the Border Bulldogs in his next two matches."
The only match that he missed during the season – their Round twelve match against the Sharks – was due to him playing for the Western Province U21 squad in the 2012 Under-21 Provincial Championship in a defeat to the Sharks U21s.
"He got off to a fantastic start in the competition, scoring two tries in their 29–8 victory over UJ in the opening round of the competition."

Larmor was opposed to the spacetime interpretation of the Lorentz transformation in special relativity because he continued to believe in an absolute aether.
"In his book Aether and Matter (1900), he again presented the Lorentz transformations, time dilation and length contraction (treating these as dynamic rather than kinematic effects)."
Larmor also created the first solar system model of the atom in 1897.

He was awarded the Poncelet Prize for 1918 by the French Academy of Sciences.
Larmor held that matter consisted of particles moving in the aether.
"Motivated by his strong opposition to Home Rule for Ireland, in February 1911 Larmor ran for and was elected as Member of Parliament for Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency) with the Conservative party."
He united Lord Kelvin's model of spinning gyrostats (see Vortex theory of the atom) with this theory.
"He remained in parliament until the 1922 general election, at which point the Irish question had been settled."
Larmor believed the aether was separate from matter.

"That led to the departure and expulsion of many volunteers in chapter managements, to the establishment of local alternative organizations, and to calls for Den Haan's resignation."
"== Personal life ==
Den Haan lives in Woerden."
"However, the latter dropped out and endorsed Den Haan to prevent Van Brenk from winning."
Den Haan said the party's positions would not deviate much from those of 50PLUS.
Volunteers were only able to use money with the approval of ANBO's headquarters.
Den Haan stated that the largest subsidiaries would keep their disproportional influence and that she wanted subsidiaries to have more say in issues in their respective areas of specialty.
Volunteers said their integrity had been publicly put into doubt and called it part of an effort to diminish the power of the chapters.
"In July 2016, ANBO's management disbanded all its chapters."
"At the start of the 1990s, after having studied business administration at The Hague University of Applied Sciences for four years, she took a job as operations coordinator at a catering and party service company."
"After she had received several reactions, Den Haan began volunteering on weekends."
"However, she told that her idea to pool policy advisors was rejected."
"Den Haan attended the secondary schools Kalsbeek College and Minkema College, located in the same town, at mavo and havo level."
"A local judge determined that the suspension was unjust, as no proof was found to support the accusations."
"She managed to improve the financial situation of the association, which was €3 million in debt and was close to bankruptcy."
"During an emergency general meeting in July, Den Haan was voted out by the COC's members, while the board resigned."
ANBO became an affiliate of the trade union federation FNV in 2009 after the organizations had cooperated on multiple issues.
"The conflict had started during the campaign, and the board had written a letter with numerous complaints about Den Haan's leadership to all 50PLUS members in late April."
"During the campaign, Den Haan explained that her party had abandoned its position that the retirement age should unconditionally return to 65 in order to finance an increase in the state pension."
"Den Haan defended herself, saying that she was visiting him informally in her capacity as a private citizen."
"When the organizational structure of the FNV was reformed in 2013 after internal struggles, ANBO ended its membership."
She was placed second on the party list of Democrats 66 (D66) and was elected to the municipal council.
"The number of ANBO members decreased from 180,000 to 125,000 in the following months, causing the organization to lose its position as the largest Dutch interest group for seniors to the Catholic Unie KBO."
She was the managing director of LGBT rights organization COC Nederland from 2001 to 2004 and subsequently filled that same position at senior advocacy group ANBO.
"In an interview, she told that she had chosen for the federation because she wanted to work at a more idealistic place."
"Later that year, she offered her help to elderly care facilities following personnel shortages due to the COVID-19 pandemic."
"Subsequently, the board of directors suspended her in spring 2004 and started a dismissal procedure, arguing that her leadership had resulted in a budget deficit and that she had pitted employees of COC against the board."
This was because the speaker argued that it was impossible for someone to split off from a one-person group.
She was an operations coordinator and later operations and product group manager at Van der Kruijs RPD Groep until 1998.
"Den Haan was not re-elected in the 2010 elections, being placed seventh on the party list, but she remained a staffer assisting the group."
"However, she described Goud as having a less populist style and being more leftist on issues such as climate and migration."
She subsequently studied nursery at a university of applied sciences and worked as a hospital nurse.
"To decrease her workload as an independent politician, Den Haan started cooperating with Sylvana Simons (BIJ1) and Caroline van der Plas (BBB), who also have a one-person group, while she mostly focussed on elderly policy and income development."
"Simultaneously, a supervisory board and a members council, whose chair was chosen by Den Haan, were formed."
"Before her election, 50PLUS had opposed reforms of the pension system proposed by the cabinet, unions, and employers' associations, but Den Haan had supported them while she was ANBO director."
She is divorced and has two daughters and one son.
"After the election program was released, Den Haan called it a done deal and said that she wanted the party to be involved in working out the details of the reforms."
She left her post on 1 November.
"Den Haan again became a member of the SER when the VCP received a second seat the following year, but left the advisory body in the first half of 2019."
"During an online convention on 3 October, she won the member election with 52% of the 362 votes and thus officially became the party's lijsttrekker."
She succeeded Henk Krol and was elected to the House of Representatives.
"Her father worked as manager of a mortar factory, while her mother was a hairdresser."
"According to Den Haan, the reason was that they were unable to explain the division's finances, but a judge determined three removals were unjust."
"She said that, under her plan, people who want to retire at 65 as opposed to 67 should make an additional contribution to their state pension."
She left Fundis at the end of November 2018.
Den Haan left the latter organization after she had been chosen in October 2020 to lead the pensioners' party 50PLUS in the 2021 general election.
Members of the management of the Overijssel division who had criticized those reforms were expelled.
The only incumbent on 50PLUS's party list for the 2021 general election was its lijstduwer.
"The move was supported by Den Haan, who argued that it would give ANBO more tools to serve the interests of the elderly."
"Even though Den Haan left her party, she remained a parliamentary group as opposed to an independent House member and kept the same funding and speaking time during debates."
50PLUS had been without a leader since Henk Krol had left the party in May to establish the Party for the Future.
"Because of this, she advocated management reforms."
"== Early life and career ==
Den Haan was born on 24 August 1967 in Woerden in the province Utrecht."
"She was sworn in on 31 March and is on every standing committee including as vice chair of the Committee for Education, Culture and Science."
"In August 2021, she met with the Minister of Tourism and Environment of the unrecognized state of Northern Cyprus while on holiday."
They accused her of not cooperating with the leadership and of following a progressive course without consultation.
"Following an internal conflict within 50PLUS, she left the party in May 2021 while keeping her seat."
Den Haan's father died when she was 18 years old.
She was not a member of the party.
Den Haan also wanted to widen the party's reach by taking care of future elderly people instead of solely defending the interests of the current elderly generation.
The advocacy group joined the Trade Union Federation for Professionals (VCP) in 2017.
The party's leadership put Den Haan forward as their preferred lijsttrekker during a press conference in August after fourteen candidates had applied.
"Five other people ran for the position including members of parliament Corrie van Brenk, who received 42% of the vote, and Léonie Sazias."
This led to criticism from the Cypriot Minister of Finance.
"Den Haan had in turn reacted in an internal memo that she had been sabotaged, teased, and intimidated."
Den Haan joined the supervisory board of Fundis (then called Vierstroom) in December 2010 and became the board's chair in September 2011.
"In September 2015, ANBO's management blocked access to the bank accounts and member registries of its nearly 400 chapters after it said that at least €200,000 had been embezzled and that a letter had been sent calling to embezzle more."

Farbmann] was a simple teacher [at the Balfour College in Tel Aviv] in his last years because he could not make a living as a sculptor""."

"His architecture became more overtly neoclassical, though it remained deeply imbued with modernism."
"This produced a wave of large-scale urban projects, most notably three museum projects for Düsseldorf, Cologne, and Stuttgart."
"Another result of Stirling & Gowan's collaboration is the Department of Engineering building at the University of Leicester (1959–63), noted for its technological and geometric character, marked by the use of three-dimensional drawings based on axonometric projection seen either from above (in a bird's eye view) or below (in a worm's eye view)."
He died on 25 June 1992 following surgical complications.

"Hayflick is the recipient of more than twenty-five major awards including the $20,000 Brookdale Award and the Kleemeier Award from the Gerontological Society of America, the Biomedical Sciences and Aging Award from the University of Southern California, The Karl August Forster Lectureship of the Academy of Sciences and Literature and the University of Mainz, Germany, the Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation Research Recognition Award, the Lifetime Achievement Award of the Society for In Vitro Biology, the Sandoz Prize from the International Association of Gerontology, and the Presidential Award from The International Organization for Mycoplasmology."
His discoveries overturned a 60-year old dogma that all cultured cells are immortal.
"== Biography ==
Leonard Hayflick was born 20 May 1928 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."
"Hayflick is the author of the book, How and Why We Age, published in August 1994 by Ballantine Books, NYC and available since 1996 as a paperback."
"To this day, all inverted microscopes used in cell culture laboratories worldwide are descended from this prototype."
"He hypothesized that because WI-38 was free from contaminating viruses, it could replace the then widely used primary monkey kidney cells, which contained several dangerous contaminating viruses."
"The behavior of Stanford and the NIH was later condemned by 85 prominent biologists who viewed him as having been ""exonerated"" by subsequent events."
He received his Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania in 1956.
"Indeed, WI-38 became used worldwide for human virus vaccine manufacture, to the benefit of billions of people."
"Hayflick was the recipient of the 2001, $10,000 Life Extension Prize and Laureate Diploma from the Regenerative Medicine Secretariat for his ""...discovery of the finite replicative capacity of normal human diploid cells..."""
He demonstrated that his normal human cell strains were free from contaminating viruses.
Hayflick produced the first oral polio vaccine ever made on his normal human cell strain WI-38.
He is known for discovering that normal human cells divide for a limited number of times in vitro (refuting the contention by Alexis Carrel that normal body cells are immortal).
Hayflick demonstrated that normal cells have a memory and can remember at what doubling level they have reached.
This is known as the Hayflick limit.
"WI-38, or new diploid cell strains, are used today for the manufacture of most human virus vaccines produced throughout the world including those for poliomyelitis, rubella, rubeola, varicella, mumps, rabies, adenoviruses and hepatitis A."
WI-38 is now used for the production of all of the Rubella Virus vaccine used in the Western Hemisphere.
Extensive biography from Max Planck Institute for Human Development
His cell strain WI-38 soon replaced primary monkey kidney cells and became the substrate for the production of most of the world's human virus vaccines.
"Hayflick and his associates have vehemently condemned ""anti-aging medicine"" and criticized organizations such as the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine."
"In 1997, Hayflick was elected Academician and Foreign Member of the Ukrainian Academy of Medical Sciences."
Hayflick was also a consultant at Genentech from a year after its founding and for the next 25 years.
"The etiological agent was named by him as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and was first grown by Hayflick on a medium he developed and that bears his name."
"He was a founding member of the Council of the National Institute on Aging, NIH, and chairman of its executive committee."
He is a past president of the Gerontological Society of America and was a founding member of the council of the National Institute on Aging (NIA).
He is a member of twenty scientific and professional societies in which he has held several high offices including President of the Gerontological Society of America from 1982 to 1983.
"In 1959, Hayflick developed the first inverted microscope for use in cell culture research."
"Hayflick sued the NIH, who later agreed that the issue was in dispute."
"Leonard Hayflick (born 20 May 1928) is a Professor of Anatomy at the UCSF School of Medicine, and was Professor of Medical Microbiology at Stanford University School of Medicine."
"He is now, or has been, on the Editorial Boards of more than ten professional journals."
"He interpreted his finding that normal cells are mortal, to be an indication of aging at the cellular level."
"Hayflick is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, an Honorary Member of the Tissue Culture Association and, according to the Institute of Scientific Information, is one of the most cited contemporary scientists in the world in the fields of biochemistry, biophysics, cell biology, enzymology, genetics and molecular biology."
A second Annual Hayflick Lecture was established by the University of Alabama at Birmingham in 2000.
He was Chairman of the Scientific Review Board of the American Federation for Aging Research where he was also a vice president and a Member of the board of directors.
"Hayflick, together with Paul Moorhead, were awarded the prestigious John Scott Award in 2014."
"This book has been translated into nine languages and is published in Brazil, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Japan, Poland, Russia, and Spain."
This method is now used worldwide for the production of many tons of powdered media annually for use in research laboratories and commercial production facilities.
"Prior to his seminal research, all cultured cell lines were immortal and aneuploid."
"In the mid-1990s, Hayflick was recruited by Geron founder Michael D. West to join the company's Scientific Advisory Board."
In 1998 he was elected corresponding member of the Société de Biologie of France.
"This discovery, known as the Hayflick limit, overturned a long-held belief bolstered by Alexis Carrel's work in the early 20th century that claimed that normal cells would proliferate continuously in culture."
Hayflick developed the first practical method for producing powdered cell culture media in 1965.
Hayflick developed the first normal human diploid cell strains for studies on human aging and for research use throughout the world.
"== Research ==
Hayflick is known for his research in cell biology, virus vaccine development, and mycoplasmology."
"The recipient of a number of research prizes and awards, including the 1991 Sandoz Prize for Gerontological Research, he has studied the aging process for more than fifty years."
"Hayflick discovered that the etiological agent of primary atypical pneumonia (also called ""walking pneumonia"") was not a virus as previously believed."
The American Aging Association established an Annual Hayflick Lectureship in 1997.
"He was the first to cultivate the causative organism called a mycoplasma, the smallest free-living organism, which Hayflick isolated on a unique culture medium that bears his name."
"One of these new cell strains, developed by Hayflick and his colleague Paul Moorhead at the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, called WI-38, has become the most widely used and highly characterized normal human cell population in the world."
Hayflick resigned from Stanford in 1976 in protest to the behavior of a few of its administrators who were later shown to have wrongly accepted the beliefs of an NIH accountant who was unable to understand the unique concept of title to a self-duplicating biological system.
Hayflick had found that his normal cell strain WI-38 was capable of growing all of the then known human viruses.
"In 1999, he was presented with the van Weezel Award by the European Society for Animal Cell Technology and the Lord Cohen of Birkenhead Medal by the British Society for Research on Ageing."
"He was also recruited by Michael D. West, founder of Geron (Nasdaq: GERN) and current CEO of BioTime, to join the company's Scientific and Clinical Advisory Board, on which he served from 1991-2000."
Hayflick found that only cancer cells are immortal and that normal cells have a mechanism for remembering what replication level they are at.
"In October 1928, he was named the first secretary-general of the Legislative Yuan."
"He continued serving on the National Assembly, and was an active member of the Kuomintang central committee, as well as an adviser to President Chiang Kai-shek."

"I went back to my room, packed up my stuff and left."""
"King, along with all pre-crash members of Lynyrd Skynyrd, were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006."
"King's departure in 1975 happened during a particularly difficult tour that the band dubbed the ""Torture Tour"", a tour that also claimed drummer and founding member Bob Burns weeks earlier due to a mental breakdown."
"""Mike Estes – Credits – AllMusic""."
"King died in his Nashville, Tennessee, home on August 22, 2018, at 68 years of age."
"King's guitar playing and songwriting skills were an essential element of Lynyrd Skynyrd's first three albums: (Pronounced 'Lĕh-'nérd 'Skin-'nérd), Second Helping and Nuthin' Fancy."
"The band referred to this unique new setup with King as the ""Three Guitar Army""."
I know he will be reunited with the rest of the boys in Rock and Roll Heaven.
"King was one of the guitarists in the reunited Lynyrd Skynyrd in 1987, and played a major role."
It was not until 1972 when bassist Leon Wilkeson left the band that Van Zant took King up on his offer and asked him to join Skynyrd as the band's new bassist.
"King referred to himself as a peaceful ""Southern California hippie"" and the band's predilection for drunken brawling never sat well with him; the incident which led to his departure was merely the final straw."
While with the band he played both electric guitar and bass guitar.
"Gaines was killed in a plane crash along with his sister Cassie Gaines and Van Zant on October 20, 1977."
They didn't arrive...until 10 minutes before we went on.

"King was so enamoured with the band that he told vocalist and leader Ronnie Van Zant that if they ever needed his services, he would be happy to join."
"In 2017, he appeared as a customer in the Discovery Channel docudrama Moonshiners, buying $30,000 worth of premium gin."
"He was one of the founding members of the LA-based Strawberry Alarm Clock, a mid-1960s pop psychedelic rock band."

"Edward Calhoun King (September 14, 1949 – August 22, 2018) was an American musician."
He had to leave the band again in 1996 because of congestive heart failure.
"Band biographer Mark Ribowsky wrote that King was an outsider in Lynyrd Skynyrd to some extent, as he was from Southern California and the only non-Southerner in the lineup, but that it was King who brought a level of professionalism to the fledgling band."
"Guitarist Rossington noted years later that King was the most business-minded member of Lynyrd Skynyrd, relating a story of how King would stock up on food items during stops on tour and then re-sell the items to his bandmates at a 500% markup when they later got hungry on the bus."
"King co-wrote one of the band's most recognizable hits ""Sweet Home Alabama"", and his voice counted the ""one, two, three"", before he launched into his famous riff to start the song."
"== Personal life ==
In 2011, King underwent a successful heart transplant."
His death was announced through his personal Facebook page.

"Rule changes within The Football Association at the time meant that clubs were limited to players who lived within 90 minutes' travel of the club, so Evans' opportunities were limited."
"He played the full 90 minutes but was criticised for Wigan's second goal of the game, prior to which he lost the ball on the edge of his own box, resulting in a deflected own goal by Paul McShane."

"On 8 March 2008, it was reported that he would not be prosecuted for any offence."
"Evans nearly scored a winner in injury time of the second leg which would have levelled the aggregate score; his header beat Switzerland goalkeeper Yann Sommer but was cleared off the line by defender Ricardo Rodriguez, who had converted the penalty in the first leg."

He subsequently made his first Champions League start on 12 December 2007 against Roma.
"He became a regular first-team squad member the following season, and played almost 200 matches for Manchester United in an eight-year spell; however, he fell out of favour at the club under manager Louis van Gaal and left for West Bromwich Albion."

Bechtel was picked up by the Mutuals and played in a couple of games for them before the end of the season.
"He batted .351 that season while playing in 20 of the team's 28 games, as the Athletics won the season's championship."
"After the game, he became a ""much suspected man"" by the press and his team alike, so the team suspended him for crooked play."
"Henry Chadwick once stated regarding his play: ""At the commencement of the season, Bechtel's play in left field was equal to any player, but, as the season wore on, he grew careless, and from other causes unnecessary to mention, he played poorly."
"When the 1875 season began, he again moved, this time to the Philadelphia Centennials, and was their pitcher in all 14 games that the club played."
Louisville immediately suspended him from the team.
This is the first known sale of ballplayers from one team to another in baseball history.
"George A. Bechtel (September 2, 1848 – April 3, 1921?) was an American right fielder and pitcher in professional baseball's early history."
"After just one season in New York, Bechtel moved back to Philadelphia, playing the next two seasons for the Philadelphia White Stockings with mixed success at the plate, batting .244 in 1873 and .278 in 1874."
"The National League followed the lead of the Grays and suspended Bechtel before the 1877 season, and despite attempts for re-instatement, he was denied."
"== Career ==
Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Bechtel began his professional career in 1871 for the Philadelphia Athletics, when they joined the new National Association."
Devlin himself was also banned for life the following season when he and a couple of teammates were paid for losing games.
"Bechtel had played for the Athletics in 1870, and stayed with the team during its transformation from the previous version of the National Association."
"On June 10, Bechtel wired teammate Jim Devlin a message stating ""We can make $500 if you lose the game today."
Bechtel had also played for a couple of other Philadelphia teams during his amateur career before 1870.
"Devlin wired him back explaining that he was not that kind of player, and presented the telegram to the team's management."
"== Expulsion ==
Rumors surrounded Bechtel's play ever since the late 1860s, indicating that he was a very good fielder, one of the better fielders of the day, but his play at times became sloppy."
"On May 26, 1875, after a 2–12 start, Bechtel and fellow Centennial Bill Craver were sold to the Philadelphia Athletics for $1,500."
